In our occasional “On the Job” series, we feature some of their stories. Suhani Patel, BS, Environmental HealthIntern with: Portage County Health Department, OhioI’m spending my summer as an intern with the Portage County Health Department in Ravenna, Ohio, through the National Environmental Public Health Internship Program.Part of my job involves doing water quality testing on the 70 pools in the county, running tests, collecting data, interpreting the results and educating pool managers.I was able to detect four pools that were out of compliance with state regulations. In one instance, the disinfection unit for the pool shut off. Within a few days, the pool turned green! Luckily, we were able to detect the low chlorine levels early on and take appropriate actions.I’ve also been involved with the health department's mosquito surveillance program. I trapped mosquitoes throughout the county, collected data on West Nile virus and worked on methods to control mosquito populations.Recently, Portage County held a giant fair, and the health department set up an educational booth where I was able to talk to community members about the importance of protecting against mosquito bites.I’ve been inspired by the essential work that happens in local health departments and hope to one day aid in this mission of maintaining a healthy environment for the community.

A blasting facility.These are among the worksites that I have visited this summer through my internship with SAIF Corporation, Oregon’s not-for-profit workers’ compensation insurance company.I am part of a team of six industrial hygienists based in Salem, OR, this summer. My main job is to conduct sampling for particulates, noise, mold and other chemicals.I am also working on a project to incorporate video exposure monitoring into SAIF Corp. site visit inspections.Workers are outfitted with a GoPro camera while we simultaneously monitor particulate concentrations. This new tool serves as an effective way to visually demonstrate when exposures occur and what workers were doing at the time of exposure. I am confident this tool will be useful for employers and policyholders to identify and mitigate employee exposures.My team has been very supportive, giving me opportunities to collect samples on my own, interpret results, write reports and communicate with policyholders. I work with great colleagues here! "

In our occasional “On the Job” series, we feature some of their stories. Jennifer Kim, BS, Environmental HealthIntern with: Washington State Department of Labor & Industries, Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) DOSH enforces workplace safety and health rules through training, education and inspection of Washington worksites for unsafe working conditions. As a summer intern with DOSH, most of my job involves accompanying compliance safety and health officers (CSHOs) on workplace inspections.I assist CSHOs with employee interviews and conduct sampling at a variety of workplaces. So far, I have visited a grocery store, a dental office and construction sites as part of my internship, and I have a new appreciation for how much work is required of employers to keep their workers safe.Back in the office, I write citations, compile information on businesses prior to inspections and calibrate sampling equipment.Working here has taught me how much I enjoy day-to-day variety in my job and the flexibility to set my own schedule, which is common for CSHOs.Early in my internship, I was afraid I would not be helpful to my office, but I quickly learned that CSHOs aren’t afraid to ask questions or turn to their co-workers for advice and ideas. This made me feel comfortable asking questions. Most of the time, we go search for the answer together!"
"August 26, 2019 |",A Labor Day reflection,"Boys as young as 8 years old crushed by mining equipment.Teen girls burned to death in a sweatshop fire.Loggers left penniless and jobless following terrible workplace injuries.This summer, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) is highlighting the brutal working conditions at the turn of the 20th century that led to today's laws governing workplace safety in the US.A series of posts on the L&I blog tells the story of the laborers who worked long days in filthy and dangerous jobs at a time when safety was, at best, an afterthought.It’s worthwhile reading and a timely reminder as we head into Labor Day weekend of the workplace tragedies, public outrage and early labor organizing efforts that paved the way for today’s worker health and safety laws."

"August 15, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Tribes prepare for climate change,"Researchers from the University of Washington are teaming up with the Swinomish Tribe to evaluate strategies the Swinomish are using to adapt to climate change.The results could inform how tribes across the US incorporate the latest climate science into their ongoing efforts to build healthy and more resilient communities in the face of a warming planet.Like many tribes, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community is already a leader in responding to climate change, said Dr. Jeremy Hess, project team member and associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).“This is an important next step in their work—to assess their efforts, learn what’s working and share that knowledge with others,” said Hess, who is also associate professor of emergency medicine and global health at the UW.“Overwhelming as the challenges before us may at times seem, our community and culture have also proven their ability to endure and survive many times before,” said Chairman Brian Cladoosby of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.“It is essential that our place-based knowledge is included in any discussion of climate change.”The Swinomish Reservation, located on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, sits on mostly low-lying land ringed by water. The Swinomish declared climate change an imminent threat in 2007 and developed an action plan to respond.The research team will evaluate the tribe’s efforts to incorporate “Indigenous Health Indicators” into a framework originally developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help health departments with climate change adaptation.The two-year project is supported by a $350,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.“This work is important for many reasons, including the fact that this is one of the first significant efforts on the part of a large US foundation to support research on climate change adaptation,” Hess said.Pacific Northwest tribes are expected to face some of the most acute impacts from climate change, Hess said. Many are already preparing for the future.For the nearly 1,000 people enrolled as members of the Swinomish Tribe, harvesting, preparing and using traditional foods and resources are part of the cultural fabric.The Swinomish concept of a healthy community is connected to generations of tribal knowledge and practices and shaped by relationships among humans, nature, natural resources and the spiritual realm.In 2016, Hess began advising the Swinomish Tribe on its efforts to indigenize the CDC framework, known as BRACE, or Building Resilience Against Climate Effects.That work involved incorporating localized data, feedback from tribal members and community-held values about Swinomish health definitions and priorities into the BRACE framework.The results led the Tribe to identify a number of adaptation strategies.That included adding climate-change education to the Tribe’s educational curriculum on traditional harvest practices and increasing aquaculture capacity to help protect wild clam beds from rising sea levels.The new evaluation project is an extension of that work and will contribute to the evidence base on what works to improve community health, advance health equity and address climate change in a tribal context, Hess said.The Swinomish created training videos about their experience indigenizing the BRACE framework and their community-based process for assessing the health impacts from an indigenous point of view.The team will evaluate the training videos as part of the project, and that could lead to better ways to share the Swinomish experience with other tribes “in the larger effort to support each other in addressing climate change impacts,” said Jamie Donatuto, Swinomish environmental health analyst and project lead.Other research partners include DEOHS Lecturer Nicole Errett; Swinomish Elder Larry Campbell; and Marnie Boardman of the Washington State Department of Health. The work will be guided by a technical advisory board of experts from other tribal communities."
"August 13, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Air pollution and emphysema,"Long-term exposure to air pollution—especially ozone pollution—accelerates the progression of emphysema of the lung, according to a newly published study led by the University of Washington, Columbia University and the University at Buffalo. Researchers from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and partner institutions used data from an extensive, 18-year study called the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The study involved more than 7,000 people and a detailed examination of the air pollution they encountered in six US metropolitan areas. Nearly half were nonsmokers.The study was published today in JAMA.""We were surprised to see how strong air pollution's impact was on the progression of emphysema on lung scans, in the same league as the effects of cigarette smoking,"" said Dr. Joel Kaufman, DEOHS professor and the study's senior co-author.""We really need to understand what's causing chronic lung disease, and it appears that air pollution exposures that are common and hard to avoid might be a major contributor,"" he said.The association between air pollution and emphysema progression was strongest with long-term exposure to ozone. While environmental regulations have helped reduce the levels of some kinds of air pollution over time, ozone levels have not declined, Kaufman said.Without new control strategies, “these levels are not expected to decline as climate change advances,” the study’s authors said. “More effective control strategies to reduce ozone concentrations may be needed to protect lung health.”To learn more about the research, READ THE NEWS RELEASE"

In our occasional “On the Job” series, we feature some of their stories. Juliet Lopez, BS, Environmental HealthIntern with: Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) through the National Environmental Public Health Internship Program This summer, I am working in Alaska with DEC in the Food Safety and Sanitation Program. My daily activities range from conducting quality assurance of the DEC food inspection database to assisting health investigators with food establishment inspections. I am also assisting other DEC departments with site inspections for wastewater and drinking water.Many towns in Alaska are spread out, and some can only be accessed by plane. That means inspections of food establishments are scheduled every 18 months. For some lower-risk establishments, inspections occur only once every four to five years.This surprised me—in cities like Seattle, food establishments receive surprise inspections every six months.One of the most memorable inspections I participated in involved a fast-food restaurant with a customer complaint about dirty facilities.When we went to investigate, we found serious health issues. The refrigerator's condenser was leaking dirty water into the food. A leaking washing machine caused a puddle of standing water in the walk-in refrigerator. There was no bleach sanitizer in their dish pit.We had to shut down the restaurant for the day, and the owners had to discard $2,300 worth of food!  "
"August 7, 2019 | Sarah Stanley",Flame retardants and diabetes,"Adding flame retardants to consumer products was supposed to protect people from harm when manufacturers began the practice in the 1970s.Today, we are still learning about the long-lasting damage to human health and the environment caused by flame-retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that were added to products ranging from furniture to children’s pajamas to car seats.US companies stopped using most PBDEs by the early 2000s. Still, these hardy chemicals persist in our food chain, and epidemiologists have suggested there is a potential link between PBDE exposure and diabetes.That link is the focus of new research led by Julia Yue Cui of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), supported by a five-year, $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.Her team will conduct mouse experiments investigating how early-life exposure to PBDEs in breast milk may disrupt the normal activity of microbes in the gut, potentially boosting the risk of diabetes.Insights from this research could aid future efforts to prevent diabetes in humans.The new project builds on years of work by Cui, DEOHS assistant professor, to illuminate the health effects of exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly in newborns.Her team has explored how the gut microbiome interacts with host drug-processing genes in adult mice to modify the metabolism of PBDEs and how early-life exposure to chemical activators for host drug receptors alters drug-metabolizing enzymes in the mouse liver.Last year, they reported that PBDE exposure in adult mice decreases amounts of substances produced by gut microbes that are known to protect against diabetes.Now, in collaboration with researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Arizona State University, Cui and her team will test the long-term effects of early-life PBDE exposure-driven changes to the gut microbiome in adult mice.“We hypothesize that PBDE exposure in infants might increase the risk of diabetes by reducing beneficial substances made by gut microbes and increasing harmful substances,” said Cui, who is the Sheldon D. Murphy Endowed Chair in Toxicology and Environmental Health.Cui is part of a DEOHS research initiative launched in 2017 to study microbiomes at the human-environment interface, an emerging field of research that reflects a growing body of evidence that microbiomes are essential across diverse ecosystems.All animals, including humans, are colonized by diverse microorganisms whose combined genetic capacity is a hundred-fold greater than our own, said DEOHS Professor Gerard Cangelosi, who leads the initiative.“Microbial functions impact every step of human development, from birth to death,” he said. “Our microbiota play critical roles in how our bodies interact with our environments.”“Our department is actively expanding our efforts in this area, and Dr. Cui is leading the way with her research,” Cangelosi said.It’s an emerging and exciting field of scientific inquiry, said DEOHS Chair Michael Yost.“Our department sees this as a prime opportunity for broad, cross-cutting research collaborations across the university, leading to interventions that could provide health benefits for individuals, communities and whole populations,” Yost said.For Cui’s current project, newborn mice will be exposed to PBDEs through placental transfer and breast milk from their mothers, who will receive PBDE-dosed food.As with much of Cui’s research, a key component of this project is the use of mice that are genetically altered to be more similar to humans.These mice have a gene for a protein called pregane X receptor (PXR), which is involved in diabetes in people.The researchers will pay close attention to any diabetes-promoting changes to PXR that may be caused by PBDEs.As the mice grow to adulthood, Cui and her team will monitor their microbiomes and analyze expression of mouse genes that are involved in diabetes.“We hope to understand how PBDEs affect the gut microbiome to modulate the hepatic PXR signaling and diabetes-related processes during development,” said Cui. “Since mice and humans share many molecular processes, our work could provide strong clues about what happens in people.”“The holy grail would be to identify microbial species that could be given as ‘living drugs’ to people likely to have had high PBDE exposure while breastfeeding,” Cui said.  “The microbes would produce beneficial metabolites that lower diabetes risk.”Later stages of the new project will explore whether an increased risk of diabetes could be reversed by providing beneficial microbial products to mice exposed to PBDEs in breast milk.Ultimately, collaboration with epidemiologists is needed for humans to benefit from mouse studies like these.Cui has worked with Seattle Children’s to study how the human gut microbiome develops throughout childhood. “None of this work would be possible without my team of graduate and undergraduate students, my postdoctoral fellows, my research scientists and our collaborators,” she said."
"July 29, 2019 | DEOHS staff",Making breathing room," As wildfires spread across the Pacific Northwest last summer, the Seattle area briefly earned the dubious honor of being one of the most polluted cities on earth.For four days, the smoky air grew so polluted that it was considered “unhealthy for all.” One news report noted that breathing Seattle air was like smoking seven cigarettes.Climate researchers say we can expect to see longer and more severe smoke events over the coming decades with significant public health impacts. That has sparked new interest in the idea of clean air shelters that can provide respite to people affected by wildfire smoke.Now researchers at the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) are collaborating with the Tulalip Tribes on research that could help identify the best location for such shelters on their reservation, located north of Seattle. Wildfire smoke contains particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter known as PM2.5—particles that are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. This kind of air pollution is linked to everything from preterm births to heart disease and premature death.Experts have long been stymied on how to measure air pollution exposure at the individual level, which can vary widely depending on factors like where you live and how much time you spend outside.Orly Stampfer, a DEOHS PhD student in Environmental and Occupational Hygiene, is testing the use of low-cost air monitors that can measure particle levels in the air and display the data in real-time on a map.At the invitation of Dean Henry, a Tulalip tribal member and clean air advocate, Stampfer worked with tribal staff to deploy the sensors around the Tulalip Reservation.She placed the monitors inside and outside a teen community center and an early learning center, as well as another outdoor location to determine how indoor air quality differs from outside, both during wildfires and during ambient conditions. Even in the absence of wildfires, Gillian Mittelstaedt, Stampfer’s collaborator and director of the Tribal Healthy Homes Network, said people living on the Tulalip Reservation often suffer from wood smoke trapped in temperature inversions.“These contaminants are a new and growing risk factor for those with asthma, as well as those with lung and cardiovascular diseases,” Mittelstaedt said. “Wildfires have now created a sense of crisis that has increased interest in air quality.”The data that Mittelstaedt and Stampfer collect this year will be used to help identify the best places for clean air shelters on the reservation.Promoting the use of clean air shelters during wildfires should, in turn, help reduce unplanned doctor visits and trips to the emergency room, Mittelstaedt said.Shelters typically are either built or retrofitted with high-tech filtration systems and seals that help reduce fine particles, providing a safer place for people to spend time during wildfires.In June, the city of Seattle announced a pilot program that will retrofit five public facilities, including the Rainier Beach Community Center and two buildings at Seattle Center, to serve as air shelters as early as this summer.This kind of retrofitting can be expensive. DEOHS Associate Professor Edmund Seto said research on whether clean air shelters actually reduce harm is still inconclusive.“We know that air pollution is not healthy and that it has a broad range of health effects. We know that you should do the best you can to avoid exposure. But the solutions we have aren’t terrific,” Seto said.""If clean air shelters are part of our strategy to protect people's health during smoke events, it is critical that we begin to evaluate their effectiveness and who may benefit from them,"" he said.Stampfer recently did a literature review on the efficacy of air shelters and found little evidence to date.“That doesn’t mean staying inside your home or an air shelter isn’t helpful,” she added. “It just means there haven’t been enough published studies on their effectiveness.”Mittelstaedt noted that while wildfires used to be considered an acute exposure, they are now so extended and frequent that epidemiologists are beginning to consider smoke as a chronic exposure—making research like Stampfer’s more important than ever."

"July 15, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Mapping environmental inequality,"Washington is on the road to 100 percent clean energy with the passage of a new law championed by Gov. Jay Inslee that sets targets for achieving zero-carbon electricity by 2045.Senate Bill 5116 calls for transforming the state’s electric grid and energy supply while “ensuring that the benefits of this transition are broadly shared throughout the state.”Research led by the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and our partners will be a key part of meeting that mandate.Policymakers will use data from an interactive mapping tool developed by DEOHS and our research collaborators to help identify Washington communities that are the most highly impacted by fossil fuel pollution and climate change as part of moving toward a clean-power economy.“This work is at the forefront of understanding health, climate and ecological impacts and ensuring equitable access to healthy communities,” said DEOHS Chair Michael Yost, part of the research team that will lead the work.“Having accurate, localized data about environmental risks is critical to inform decisions about funding priorities, environmental policy and strategies to help communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution,” he said.The burden of fossil fuel pollution falls unevenly across Washington communities.In fact, where you live, your income, race and language ability are among the factors that influence the health risks you face from pollution, according to research by DEOHS and our partners.Yost’s team collaborated with state agencies and community-based organizations to launch the mapping tool earlier this year. It ranks the cumulative risk each community faces from environmental factors that influence health outcomes. The team also includes DEOHS Associate Professor Edmund Seto and PhD student Esther Min.The new law calls for additional research by DEOHS to build on the mapping tool and inform a new cumulative impact analysis required by state lawmakers to be completed by December 2020 as part of the new clean energy law.That effort will tap new data sources that could eventually include topics such as:Currently, the tool includes 19 indicators of community health, including exposure to diesel emissions, proximity to hazardous waste facilities, housing affordability and race.These are combined into a cumulative score reflecting environmental and socioeconomic risk factors that allows for comparison across Washington’s more than 1,450 US Census tracts. The cross-sector collaboration that developed the tool includes DEOHS; Front and Centered, a coalition of community organizations in Washington; the state Department of Health (DOH); the state Department of Ecology; and the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.DOH, which hosts the mapping tool on its website, is already getting calls from utilities as they assess how the new law will affect them, said Jennifer Sabel, senior DOH epidemiologist. DOH is currently organizing a working group that includes DEOHS to develop the impact analysis.“We’re planning to use the same platform and a lot of the same indicators” to build out the tool, she said.The UW Climate Impacts Group will be an important new partner in developing the impact analysis, providing expertise and data on localized climate impacts.It’s an opportunity to help build “climate-ready communities,” said Heidi Roop, a DEOHS affiliate assistant professor and lead scientist for science communication with the Climate Impacts Group.“The real power of this is the opportunity to be forward-looking and to better connect people to what climate change may mean in their own communities,” she said.For example, how will sea-level rise affect different communities along our coastline? How could changes in stream flow and temperature affect water quality? If you are an outdoor worker or an asthma patient, how will climate change affect you?“It’s increasingly important to help people make connections between environmental impacts like air pollution and climate change and how it manifests in their day-to-day lives,” Roop said, so that communities can plan and seek resources they will need to address the impacts."

"July 10, 2019 | Sarah Stanley",When pesticides drift,"Many Washington growers rely on pesticides to ensure a bountiful harvest in a state ranked as the top apple producer in the US.But pesticides sprayed from tractors onto crops can drift into neighboring farmland, risking crop damage and farmworkers' health.Scientists at UW’s Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center (PNASH) have built a multipronged, collaborative research program that investigates factors contributing to pesticide drift.Now, thanks to new state legislation, their work will directly inform efforts to make spraying safer.“To minimize drift, you need to be smart about how you spray,” said Michael Yost, PNASH director and chair of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), which houses the PNASH Center.“We’re leading research that could help make sprayer technologies and practices safer and more effective.”For example, recently published research led by Magali Blanco, a DEOHS doctoral student, suggests that newer tower sprayers that spray pesticides horizontally onto fruit trees are less likely to cause drift than traditional airblast sprayers that disperse pesticides more vertically into the air.“Tower sprayers can get nozzles much closer to the target, reducing drift risk,” said Edward Kasner, outreach director of PNASH and co-author of the new study.That paper is the latest from PNASH’s Reducing Agricultural Worker Risks through New and Emerging Technologies project, headed by PNASH founding director Richard Fenske.For the same project, Kasner developed a method to compare the drift potential of different sprayer technologies. He also contributed to additional research led by Blanco suggesting that real-time monitoring of airborne particles could help reduce drift, especially if combined with wind monitoring.A new bill passed this spring by the Washington State Legislature will boost the impact of PNASH’s pesticide drift work.The bill establishes a pesticide application safety panel that brings together lawmakers, state agencies, farmworkers, growers and universities to improve training, safety and data collection around pesticide application and exposure. The panel stems from an earlier pesticide safety work group that united a similar selection of stakeholders, including Yost. Kasner will serve as the PNASH representative on the new panel.“This is a great opportunity to learn from each other and figure out practical solutions that will work for everyone,” Kasner said. “We at UW can’t tell people how to farm, but we can share our findings to help the community make decisions about what works best for them.”Also joining the new panel are two key PNASH research collaborators—Washington State University and the Washington State Department of Health (DOH).“PNASH and DOH research has helped to shed light on the extremely complex issue of pesticide drift,” said DOH epidemiologist Joanne Prado. “The leap from our work to actual impacts on human health may not be a long one.”Prado and Kasner worked together to link past pesticide drift incidents with concurrent weather data as part of an effort to develop practical tools that alert growers and workers when weather conditions could cause pesticide drift.Meanwhile, Kasner is also exploring whether worker safety could be improved by implementing notification systems, in which growers alert each other when they will be spraying.“All of these projects could help shape discussions and actions of the new safety panel, and we look forward to additional agency partnerships stemming from these efforts,” Kasner said. “At the end of the day, participation from workers and growers will be essential.”"
"July 1, 2019 | Lynn Schnaiberg",Natural climate solutions,"Trees are one of our best allies in combating climate change, capturing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and preventing them from accumulating in the atmosphere.Now researchers at the University of Washington and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) are investigating tropical forests as a natural climate solution that could help protect human health, create climate-resilient communities and slow the pace of planetary warming.The pilot study is part of a new frontier of research at the intersection of human health, climate change and conservation. The research involves researchers from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), TNC and the UW College of the Environment.“Cutting down forests not only leads to more heat exposure but also contributes to warming,” dealing a double blow to human health, said Dr. June Spector, DEOHS associate professor and co-leader of the study.Natural climate solutions through land conservation, restoration and management could be a cost-effective strategy to both mitigate climate change and increase human resilience to its effects.In the tropical forests of Indonesia’s East Kalimantan region, farmers routinely work in temperatures that pose a threat to their health.Villagers working in open areas may face up to 6.5 hours of exposure to potentially dangerous temperatures. In nearby tropical forests, average ambient temperatures are as much as 8.3°C cooler compared to open areas.As tropical forests are cleared for logging, oil palm plantations, mining and other uses, what does it mean for the health of the estimated 800 million rural villagers living in the world’s tropical forest nations?The new study was sparked in part by the team’s earlier findings from East Kalimantan and will study up to 24 countries with tropical forests. David Battisti, UW Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, is also a co-leader of the study.Spector said the study fills a gap for heat-related health data for tropical developing countries. Most existing work has been done in urban areas and more-developed countries.And while the pilot study focuses on rural tropical communities, the eventual aim is broader: To help develop climate-resilient communities around the globe.The research team aims to estimate the potential benefits of the cooling services that forests provide by quantifying for the first time the large-scale effects of temperature rise on human health and economic productivity.Researchers will examine the impacts of past forest change on local climate, human heat exposure and risks of adverse heat health outcomes, as well as model impacts from future forest change. They will also estimate the economic cost of impacts on labor productivity and deaths linked to heat exposure.According to a TNC study, natural climate solutions can provide up to 37 percent of the mitigation needed by 2030 to keep global temperature rise below 2°C—the target of the Paris Climate Agreement.The potential benefits of natural climate solutions on human health have received little attention until now, said Yuta Masuda, TNC senior sustainable development and behavioral scientist.“In general, this intersection of conservation and human health is quite new,” Masuda said. “There’s a broader push to understand how human health is tied to nature and conservation.”Rural subsistence farmers like those in East Kalimantan are especially vulnerable to warming and heat-related health challenges.They work outside, rely almost exclusively on agriculture and natural resource extraction to make a living and have limited—or no—access to electricity for fans or air conditioning.Heat strain can increase the risk of serious health outcomes, Spector said. Heat can impact cognitive performance and can boost the risk of traumatic injury as things like balance and concentration are impacted.Even young, otherwise healthy people doing strenuous work can die from heat stroke. And heat can inflict short-term kidney stress and have cardiovascular impacts.Most heat-related occupational health research has focused on heat exposure in a defined indoor or outdoor workplace, Spector said.“This research goes beyond that to grapple with the source of outdoor ambient heat exposure—namely, global temperature rise,” Spector said.“Conservation approaches that benefit health, reduce heat exposure and reduce longer-term global temperature rise could be a smart strategy moving forward.”The research is funded by the UW Population Health Initiative and the UW Office of Global Affairs. The research team includes: Spector, Battisti, Lucas Zeppetello and Luke Parsons (University of Washington); and Masuda, Nick Wolff and Timm Kroeger (TNC)."
"June 28, 2019 | Lisa Hayward Watts",Lung health in coffee workers," Drinking coffee is linked to all kinds of health benefits, from reducing your risk of heart disease to potentially protecting you from cancer of the uterus and liver.But could the process of preparing your daily cup of joe be hazardous to the health of your barista?Professor Christopher Simpson of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) was recently awarded a grant from the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries to examine respiratory hazards in the coffee industry.His research will focus on a chemical called diacetyl, which is naturally produced in the coffee roasting process and may be found in some flavorings.Diacetyl is also a chemical flavoring added to microwave popcorn. It has been associated with high rates of a rare disease known as “popcorn lung,” which damages the smallest airways of the lungs, interfering with the body’s ability to get oxygen.While it poses no risk for consumers, extreme levels of airborne diacetyl may be linked to this serious and irreversible lung disease, formally called bronchiolitis obliterans.Recent studies have shown that workers in large commercial coffee production facilities are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of diacetyl.“However, the levels of diacetyl present in smaller craft coffee processing facilities or coffee shops where coffee roasting, grinding and brewing take place are largely unknown,” said Simpson, who is a principal investigator with the UW Interdisciplinary Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment based in DEOHS.Simpson is launching a one-year study of diacetyl levels at Olympic Crest Coffee Roasters, a boutique coffee shop in Olympia, WA. He will lead a team that measures levels of diacetyl released during coffee grinding and brewing.DEOHS graduate student Hannah Echt will take air samples from which diacetyl gas will be separated and quantified by the department’s Environmental Health Lab. Echt’s studies are supported by funding from the Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety, housed in DEOHS.The team will also design and test an emission control device that could reduce exposure for baristas.Next fall, after the emission control device has been installed in areas with the highest diacetyl levels, Echt will return to repeat the sampling.The new study follows a 2018 pilot study where levels of diacetyl were measured in small coffee shops in Canada.In all cases, diacetyl levels in barista work areas exceeded the recommended exposure levels defined by federal regulators.“That was a surprise,” according to Simpson. “Our hope is that we will increase awareness of this problem, define its extent and disseminate an effective control solution,” he said.“It’s a pleasure to get out in the field to work with small businesses who take pride in what they do and want to do the right thing for their employees.”Funding for this research is provided by the Safety & Health Investment Projects Grant Program, State of Washington, Department of Labor & Industries."
"June 21, 2019 | Starre Vartan",Clean air warrior,"2004""The work I’m most proud of as I look back involves people: mentoring students and caring for patients.""“Here at the UW, I was a little fish in a big pond, which was good for me since I was able to exploit a lot of projects that were going on. That’s helped make this a gratifying and rewarding 15 years.”- SVERRE VEDALIn Dr. Sverre Vedal’s four decades as an epidemiologist, he has served in many roles: teacher, researcher, international collaborator, US regulatory policy adviser.His favorite role? Doctor.Doing clinical work as a pulmonologist is “precious, engaging and challenging—I appreciate it more as I’ve gotten older and look at it as a great privilege to be involved in scientific research as well as directly with patients,” said Vedal, professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Seeing patients at the UW Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic is one of the things Vedal will miss most after he retires this month from the department.DEOHS Chair Michael Yost calls Vedal ""an outstanding researcher, colleague and mentor.""""One of my best experiences at UW was working with him when he directed the Center for Clean Air Research project. I learned a lot from him about how to guide a large multidisciplinary team and produce great science,"" Yost said.""Even today, I rely on that experience as an example of doing things right.""    Armed with an MD from the University of Colorado and an MSc in epidemiology from Harvard University, Vedal began his work at the University of British Columbia and National Jewish Health in Denver before moving to the UW in 2004.Vedal focused his research on the adverse health effects of community air pollution and occupational lung disease.When he began that work in the 1980s, “I started off doing basic analysis on hard-frame computers. Statistics software wasn’t nearly as well-developed as it is now,” he said.Advances in statistical methodologies for estimating air pollution exposure and assessing relationships between exposure and health have facilitated higher-quality and more complex research. “I’ve been fortunate to have wonderful collaborations with statistics and biostatistics colleagues at DEOHS,” Vedal said.Unexpected technological breakthroughs have also pushed the field, leading to surprises.“One of the biggest puzzles in air pollution has been that even low levels of exposure can have severe health effects [in some people]. Understanding this and the mechanisms underlying it has been fascinating and has required tech advances in both biology and air pollution,” he said. Those breakthroughs required contributions from many disciplines. That was the premise for the EPA Center for Clean Air Research at the UW that Vedal headed up for many years. The center combined toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, biostatistics and epidemiology. Together, these disciplines provided the tools for investigating exposure-response relationships, reducing uncertainty about cause and effect and giving insight into how low-level air pollution exposures could be so harmful.Now, researchers are poised to better identify who gets sick from air pollution “beyond just simplistic notions of susceptibility.”Vedal brought his expertise to his role advising the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on clean air policy. He served on an air pollution panel that reviewed scientific assessments and provided policy recommendations for the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.That work ended abruptly last fall when the Trump administration dismantled the group. Vedal and other scientists objected to the move.“From my perspective, it’s an attempt to try to remove science from the policy-setting process,” Vedal said.He spends two months each year working with Chinese collaborators on air pollution exposure and health studies as part of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences in Beijing—work that will continue after his retirement.“These collaborations have allowed me to change direction by assessing air pollution exposure interventions experimentally as well as to continue on looking at air pollution impacts,” said Vedal. “That’s one thing that will keep me busy.”"
"June 18, 2019 | Allegra Abramo",Climate challenge accepted," Can you solve this medical mystery?A New York woman returned home from a Florida vacation with a fever, headache and chills. Despite treatment, her condition worsened, and she eventually developed severe joint pain and a rash across her body.That was the challenge Dr. Jeremy Hess, associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), recently posed to a group of Bellevue, WA, high school students.The Newport High School students gathered under the library’s vaulted ceiling for a climate and technology event this month that kicked off with a talk by Hess, co-director of the UW Center for Health and the Global Environment. He is also an associate professor of Emergency Medicine and Global Health and a lead author on the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sixth assessment report.Modeled after the television show “Shark Tank,” the event also featured student presentations pitching Hess and a Newport teacher on their ideas to address climate change. When no one could guess what had sickened the woman, Hess revealed that she had contracted a mosquito-borne tropical disease called dengue.Also called break-bone fever, it was once common in the southern U.S. but was eradicated decades ago. The New York case marked the first case acquired in Florida in at least 40 years and the beginning of a resurgence of the disease in the US.“You can now identify outbreaks of climate-sensitive disease that are driven by climate change all over the United States,” Hess told the students.Even more concerning than the spread of disease, Hess said, are climate change’s impacts on other conditions that influence of our well-being.For example, some regions can expect drops in crop production, more heat-related deaths and more conflict and violent crime.Most activities that emit greenhouse gases—like burning fossil fuels—also emit other pollutants harmful to health, Hess noted.Thus, cutting greenhouse gas emissions not only reduces the risk of dangerous climate change, Hess explained, it is “also good for human health, and those benefits hit almost immediately . . . In many cases, the efforts to reduce emissions actually pay for themselves.”Yet we remain on a path of rising emissions, Hess said. Stabilizing warming below the Paris climate agreement goal of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) will be ""effectively impossible"" without radical reinvestments by 2035.With a 3-degree change, “everything starts to get pretty bad,” Hess said. “I really hope we don’t get there.” Students presented a range of ideas for addressing climate change that spanned technology, policy and education.A trio of students explained their idea for a more efficient cooling system powered by liquid nitrogen. Others explored capturing methane from cow manure, implementing a carbon cap-and-trade policy and eliminating plastic waste.One student’s presentation on the use of batteries in transportation prompted a conversation about the carbon footprint of flying. Students were surprised to learn that emissions from flying are roughly equivalent to driving on a per-mile basis. The problem, Hess pointed out, is that flights typically cover many more miles.While no students won $1 million for their ideas, they all earned extra credit and community service hours.This was the school’s first such event, which grew out of conversations between the school’s chemistry department and Jay Busch, PhD, the school’s research technology specialist.Reflecting on the future, students expressed optimism tinged with awareness that the heaviest burdens of climate change will fall on them.“A lot of the adults I know, they’re just like, ‘Oh, I’ll be dead by the time that has a major effect,’” said Newport sophomore Annika Lindberg. “So they are kind of just leaving it up to us.”That’s why Hess agreed to spend an afternoon with the students, he said.“To be frank, I feel like our generation has kind of screwed this one up,” he said. “And we're going to be handing it off [to young people]. So I want to have an open dialogue with them about that.”"
"June 17, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",2019 DEOHS graduation,"The UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) is celebrating the 57 new graduates who received their degrees this weekend.DEOHS Chair Michael Yost presided over a Friday ceremony at Foege Auditorium honoring the students, who earned Bachelor of Science, Master of Public Health, Master of Science and PhD degrees.Student speaker Claire Pendergrast, MPH in Environmental & Occupational Health, urged her fellow students to listen and learn from others, especially to those who are often left out of the decision-making process. ""I believe the first step of all public health work . . . is to listen,"" she said.Undergraduate speaker Kate Tokareva, BS in Environmental Health, highlighted the department's focus on equity, diversity, justice and inclusion as ""the core of everything we have learned.""""Whether through opening one-of-a-kind clinics that serve both homeless individuals and their pets, or by improving agricultural worker safety and health, our department is consistently leading by example and advocating for the needs of those who are often voiceless,"" Tokareva said. ""I urge us to use the privilege of the education we've been given to continue to be advocates for those who are unable to advocate for themselves."""
"June 12, 2019 | Ashlie Chandler",Caring for the caregivers,"Child-care providers play an important role in the development and health of about 10 million young children enrolled in early child care centers in the United States. They teach kids how to care for themselves by keeping good hygiene, eating healthfully, moving their bodies and navigating new emotions and social spaces.But what about the well-being of the teachers themselves?Researchers from the University of Washington School of Public Health are examining the health of this workforce and how changes in their wages could make a difference.In a study published last month in Health Affairs, data show that these teachers earn low wages and experience poor mental well-being and high rates of food insecurity.“More than 40 percent were showing signs of food insecurity, including some who were showing signs of hunger,” lead author Jennifer Otten told WTOP Radio. Otten is associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and core faculty in the Nutritional Sciences Program.“How can we expect child care teachers to be hungry and care for children for eight hours? That was a striking finding.”Additionally, 40 percent of teachers in the study, most of whom were women, were clinically depressed. This is double the national rates for women with family incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and nearly quadruple the prevalence found in women overall.“For health behaviors like diet or physical activity or how they felt about their health, teachers in our sample were pretty comparable with the population at large,” Otten said. “But when we looked at the mental well-being and the food security, the teachers appeared to be worse off.”This study focused on 366 providers from 49 early child care and education centers in Washington state and Texas. Center directors responded to questionnaires about wages and center practices and characteristics. Teachers filled out surveys about wages and jobs, mental and physical well-being, food security, chronic diseases and health behaviors.To help provide context to baseline findings, the study team conducted separate focus groups for directors and teachers at the various sites.“A lot of [the directors and teachers] commented that they did feel stressed out caring for these young children,” Otten said. “They talked about how emotionally demanding and stressful the work is and how they felt undervalued by society, in terms of compensation, their status in society, and the daily recognition from parents.”Overall, wage level was positively associated with multiple dimensions of providers’ health. Lower-paid employees worked at centers that had more children enrolled in subsidy programs and that did not offer health insurance, paid sick leave or parental or family leave.This report used baseline data from an ongoing study led by Otten that examines how wages and wage changes are affecting early child care providers’ health and the overall care environments.The study will collect four waves of data over three years, taking advantage of wage changes resulting from recent city and state minimum wage laws, including the recent minimum wage increases for some employees in Seattle and the $13.50 per hour wage rate set to take effect in Washington on January 1, 2020, for all employers.Policies and programs that raised teachers’ wages or mandated the provision of meals to both children and teachers could better support teacher health and the quality of early child care, according to study authors. Raising wages might be particularly helpful in reducing teachers’ food insecurity, if those wages contributed to higher family income.Co-authors from the UW School of Public Health are Victoria Bradford, Bert Stover, Katherine Getts and DEOHS Professor Noah Seixas. Heather Hill from the UW Evans School of Public Policy and Governance and Cynthia Osborne from the University of Texas at Austin also took part."
"June 11, 2019 | Ashlie Chandler",From harvest to health,"Before she was a food systems and sustainability expert, Yona Sipos was a video jockey for MTV Canada.Between interviews with celebrities like Avril Lavigne and music videos for Outkast's Hey Ya!, Sipos talked to her teenage audience about science—everything from how to plant an urban garden to cool science experiments to do at home.As a master’s student in agroforestry with a background in plant biology, Sipos was driven to find compelling ways and non-traditional spaces to educate people about the social impact of science and the environment.It’s with this same spirit that she now teaches undergraduates at the University of Washington School of Public Health.“I wanted to, and still do, cultivate curiosity about cool and important scientific themes that impact our daily lives, and that we can impact as well,” said Sipos, lecturer in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and core faculty in the Nutritional Sciences Program.Sipos is helping to launch the new Food Systems, Nutrition and Health major and teaches the required Food Systems: Harvest to Health class. Students examine food from the time it is seeded and harvested from farms and fields to when it arrives on plates, in bellies and beyond.They learn about the food system through hands-on activities at the UW Farm, a 1.5-acre urban farm and educational facility, and at UW Recycling, which manages the University’s recycling, composting and waste reduction efforts.Working outdoors is not new to Sipos, who grew up in gardens and on poultry and tree-fruit farms in Hamilton, Ontario, a town halfway between Toronto and Niagara Falls. Her grandparents were farmers who emigrated as refugees from Hungary in 1956.Sipos received her master’s and her PhD in Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems from the University of British Columbia.Through these real-life experiences, students can find meaning in the factors and processes that shape and constrain the food system, according to Sipos. Insights they gain represent fundamental concepts of an approach called systems thinking.Systems thinking examines linkages and interactions between the pieces that comprise the whole of the system. It is particularly useful in understanding and addressing complex problems, such as those seen in public health and global health.“Many of the problems we deal with are complex, and to grapple with them, academia has had a tradition of working on component parts, which results in working in silos and within disciplines,” Sipos said. “Systems thinking gets students to become problem-solvers, to work across disciplines and to realize the power of human and ecological connections.”Of course, researchers at the UW School of Public Health and elsewhere tackle complex problems on a daily basis, Sipos explained.But the ability of future food systems and public health leaders to perform effective systems thinking is important to the world’s future. “There’s a fallacy that we can simply outsource our food system,” Sipos said.“We go grocery shopping, and the shelves are stocked. We order meal kits and go to restaurants. We create food waste, and somebody else deals with it. But a lot of the time, having other people manage these problems has not been productive.”Sipos uses chickens, apples, corn, beef and strawberries as case studies. Focusing on a different food each week, her students examine the many facets of modern food supply—from production and processing to distribution, marketing and retail, as well as food waste and recovery.The course also explores social, cultural, political, economic, equity and ecological drivers, including the politics of farming, the price of land and the availability of young farmers.Students investigate barriers to productivity and sustainability and propose solutions. Sipos is currently developing the capstone project, a culminating experience that will pair teams of students with community partners across the local and regional food system.Prior to joining the UW, Sipos was program director for the Chesapeake Foodshed Network, a regional initiative to develop learning opportunities and work groups across the food system.A key aspect of this work was to promote community ownership and equity. She has also contributed to food system sustainability reports in Canada and the United States and served on the Vancouver Food Policy Council and the Prince George’s County Food Equity Council.Sipos uses these experiences to help frame food systems issues and to encourage students to ask questions in new and different ways that prioritize equity.“Approaching food system issues from an equity lens is about elevating those voices that are often left out of the story but who are central to how the story plays out,” Sipos said.For example, in Harvest to Health, Sipos discusses how America’s industrial agricultural system is in large part built on slavery, and she emphasizes the role of farmworkers in the food supply chain.Anyone can help make the food system more sustainable, according to Sipos. We can use canvas bags when we go grocery shopping. We can shop at farmers’ markets. We can bring our own mug to Starbucks and carry a reusable straw.For her part, Sipos and her family are on a quest to reduce their plastic consumption by making their own yogurt and cottage cheese and fermenting and pickling foods.“All of this is important, and I encourage it entirely, but the food system is what it is because of much bigger systems than those that operate at the individual level,” she said.“Part of public health is anticipating what the next crisis could be, and we are already seeing crises playing out across the food system. This is why embedding the Food Systems major within public health is very powerful.”"
"June 4, 2019 | Allegra Abramo",Getting fish to the table,"As a philosophy-student-turned-fishmonger, Zach Koehn often heard his customers talking about how healthy fish is—and how expensive it can be.Yet Koehn knew cheap fish were available. Some groups, including the Monterey, CA, fish company where he worked, were even connecting inexpensive surplus fish with low-income populations that could benefit from it.But, he wondered, “why is this not happening more?”While pursuing a PhD in the UW’s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, Koehn discovered the perfect opportunity to investigate that question: the UW’s inaugural Population Health Initiative grants. The grants encourage cross-disciplinary teams to study key challenges in population health.Koehn helped write a winning proposal that brought together faculty and staff from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and other departments and programs across the College of the Environment and the School of Public Health.Koehn worked with Jennifer Otten, DEOHS associate professor, to identify nutritionally vulnerable populations along the West Coast. By overlaying fisheries data, Koehn was able to pinpoint hot spots where large amounts of uncaught or unused fish could potentially be available.Otten was surprised by some of the preliminary findings.“I thought we had overfished everything,” said Otten, who is also core faculty in the UW Nutritional Sciences program. “I went into the project feeling like, ‘What could be out there?’”It turns out that stocks of West Coast groundfish, which include some 60 species, have rebounded in recent decades thanks to careful management. Koehn, too, was amazed by how much extra fish could be harvested while staying below levels that fisheries biologists say are sustainable.For Dover sole alone, he found, at least 20 million servings a year are left in the ocean. At less than $1 per pound off the dock, sole is also very affordable.“The fact that we're leaving millions of servings was shocking,” he said. “And it was also exciting, because to me, it’s a really strong opportunity.”How can all that fish get to people who need it?Researchers uncovered a number of challenges through interviews in coastal communities. Many individuals, as well as cooks in schools and other institutions, are uncertain how to prepare fish, said team member Emilee Quinn, research coordinator at the UW Center for Public Health Nutrition.At the same time, researchers learned about innovative approaches to connecting communities with affordable seafood. In San Diego, for example, processors turned locally caught fish into affordable products that schools could use for dishes such as fish tacos that children loved.“With just a little exposure and work, you can get people excited” about eating fish, Quinn said.Fisheries management focuses on maintaining healthy fish stocks and “on fish as a commodity,” Koehn said.What’s missing from the conversation is the role of fish in health and nutrition. He hopes this study can begin to change that. Beyond pinpointing communities where there’s both a need and an opportunity to provide fish for nutrition, the study also digs into the barriers and successes, Otten noted. “We can also give the stories behind the data.”Koehn plans to complete the study this summer. He’d like to find more organizations interested in getting fish to people who need it, and then review the entire food system to “understand the local context that’s limiting the flow of fish.”“That would be the dream,” Koehn said. “And then use that as a baseline to tell [fisheries regulators] that we need to start actively thinking about fish as a source of nutrition, and not just as a source of revenue.”Other UW investigators involved in the study include: Edward H. Allison, School of Marine and Environmental Affairs; Christopher M. Anderson and Ray Hilborn, School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences."
"May 31, 2019 | Allegra Abramo",Well water safety,"Albuquerque, NMTo conduct community-based public health research.“What really excites me about what I did in the last two years is being able to respond to a community need.”- KORI VANDERGEESTKori VanDerGeest expected a handful of participants and a lot of awkward silences when she began community interviews for her research project on well water testing in the Yakima Valley.Instead, she encountered packed meeting rooms and community members who were eager to participate, grateful for her work and concerned about the safety of the water flowing from their taps.“People came up after [the meetings] to thank us” for the opportunity to ask questions and share their stories, said VanDerGeest, an MPH student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).VanDerGeest was recognized in May as the department’s Outstanding Master’s student for 2019.“Her ability to engage with different stakeholders stands out,” said Dr. Catherine Karr, DEOHS professor and VanDerGeest’s thesis adviser. “That is a great recipe for someone who wants to do public health work and research that responds to community needs.”In the lower Yakima Valley, many local families rely on loosely regulated private wells for water. The responsibility for ensuring the water is safe falls on well owners.VanDerGeest’s study examined communication methods to promote private testing of well water in this rural, agricultural region with a predominantly Latino population.The state has detected elevated nitrate levels in the region’s groundwater. The state Department of Ecology says sources of nitrates in the area include irrigated agriculture, livestock operations, fertilizers, sewage systems, abandoned wells and other causes.Nitrates don’t impart any smell or taste to drinking water, but their effects can be devastating. Higher levels of nitrates damage the ability of blood cells to carry oxygen in infants, causing “blue baby syndrome,” a sometimes-fatal condition. Studies also link nitrates to birth defects and gastric cancer.Through interviews with stakeholders as well as focus groups with well owners and users, VanDerGeest uncovered a number of barriers to testing and treatment.Among renters, for example, concern about the possibility of losing their housing may discourage them from asking landlords to test the water. Testing can be costly, both in terms of money and time.And installing and maintaining the right water treatment system requires technical expertise that residents may not have.Her research found data visualizations and strong health messages combined with recommended actions to avoid exposure got a positive response from private well users.VanDerGeest’s winding path to public health began with “lots of lasers” while studying atmospheric pollution as a chemistry major at Pomona College.The New Mexico native went on to organize environmental justice campaigns, teach high school biology and physical science and review air pollution permits in Texas.Public health, she eventually realized, was a way of “combining science with community needs in a way that is action-oriented and can be accompanied by policy changes.”It took a trip to Japan for VanDerGeest to discover the University of Washington. When she heard relatives there sing UW’s praises, she made plans to visit the UW and came away impressed by faculty members’ commitment to community partnerships.As part of her research, VanDerGeest presented public comments to the Governor's Interagency Council on Health Disparities and engaged with county and state officials, community organizations and other researchers.VanDerGeest is determined to see her research translate into better outreach to Yakima Valley residents. In collaboration with a student in the College of the Environment, she is developing fact sheets that promote well-water testing and help people understand the results.She also hopes to partner with a local Spanish-language radio station to create a radionovela, a radio drama to engage listeners on the issue of well water contamination and testing.This work “will carry on beyond her,” Dr. Karr predicts.After graduation this month, VanDerGeest plans to continue community-based public health research that integrates qualitative and quantitative methods, ideally back home in New Mexico.VanDerGeest’s research was supported by a grant from the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center at DEOHS. She also received awards from the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice and the Russell L. Castner Endowed Student Research Fund."
"May 30, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Leading by example,"A nationally recognized air pollution researcher at the University of Washington was selected this week as the 2019 outstanding faculty mentor by graduate students in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Professor Lianne Sheppard is an expert in measuring the health effects of exposure to air pollution. Sheppard, also a professor of biostatistics, has served on numerous scientific advisory panels and recently spearheaded an analysis of the weed killer glyphosate that found the widely used herbicide increases the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by 41 percent.Her students say Sheppard’s personal integrity and principled approach to science will have a lasting influence on their lives.In all of my years in academia (both undergrad and grad school), I have not encountered a faculty member like Lianne.Her expertise touches every single DEOHS grad student through a required thesis proposal class. Through Lianne, students learn one of the most essential skills they could learn in graduate school: research planning and proposal writing. Few faculty members have such a wide impact.She prioritizes weekly meetings and check-ins with her students, and these meetings are more than a formality. She takes time to provide substantive feedback to make her students stronger scientists. She challenges them to stretch themselves, and she guides them in setting goals.She helps her students develop strong quantitative research skills, including in analysis planning and data science.And Lianne also runs not one, but two (!) training grants that provide DEOHS students with essential financial support—another way she demonstrates her dedication to student success.Rachel ShafferPhD student, Environmental ToxicologyLianne truly listens to student concerns and has made a big impact in equipping DEOHS students to succeed as researchers and as people.She teaches a course to help students develop research skills through writing and critiquing research proposals, using it to guide students through the essential (and challenging) task of applying their skills to real-world research challenges. She makes the course relevant to students with a broad range of research interests and methodological approaches.This year, she made time in her jam-packed schedule to work with students to support “DEOHS 101,” a fall-quarter course designed to orient incoming students to the department and the graduate student experience.Claire PendergrastMPH student, Environmental and Occupational Health    From Lianne, I have learned that research should always be ethical, reproducible and guided by science every step of the way.She encourages us to be as involved as possible in our areas of interest, regularly sharing events of interest.

"May 24, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",UW research showcase,"Research led by Environmental Health majors in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) was featured yesterday at the School of Public Health's Undergraduate Symposium.The annual event showcases student research, internships and capstone experiences across the School’s undergraduate majors and minors.The symposium highlights the breadth of research opportunities available to DEOHS undergraduate students, who complete a required 400-hour internship as part of their academic program.Ten of the 31 research posters selected for the symposium were from DEOHS undergraduates.As an applied science program, the Environmental Health major provides professional training and hands-on experience for the next generation of environmental public health practitioners, said Tania Busch Isaksen, DEOHS lecturer and undergraduate program coordinator.Mariah Dittmore: Using Low Cost Air Monitoring Sensors to Study and Analyze VOC Exposure Levels in Cannabis Grow-OpsAmanda Durkin: Establishing an Air Monitoring Network in the Methow ValleyKatelyn Kern: N95 Mask Distribution Effectiveness in Okanogan CountyJustine Marecaux and Darcy Van Deventer: Wildfire Smoke Risk Communication Efficacy: Using the Extended Parallel Process Model to Summarize Washington State’s 2018 Statewide Smoke Event Public Health MessagingSuhani Patel, Margarita Ankoudinova, Shelby Cansler, Veronica James and Audrey Immel: Wastewater Intervention Approaches for Earthquake Disaster Response: An Integrated Literature Review to Inform Future Response Efforts for Washington StateSilvia Rus: Arsenic in St. Mary’s County Drinking WaterAna Silverstein: Language Barriers in Retail Food EnvironmentsVeda Ting: Content Needs Assessment and Evaluation of N95 Mask Video-Based Education for Wildfire Smoke EventsKate Tokareva: West Nile Virus Surveillance for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe during Summer 2018Darcy Van Deventer and Justine Marecaux: Wildfire Smoke Risk Communication Efficacy: Using the Extended Parallel Process Model to Summarize"
"May 23, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Measuring the toll of wildfires,"Hingham, MAA career in occupational health and an eventual MBA degree.“One thing I will miss about the UW is the opportunity for constant learning and growth.”- AMANDA DURKINAmanda Durkin spent last summer quite literally living and breathing her University of Washington research project.The UW Environmental Health student embedded herself in Washington’s Methow Valley at the height of 2018’s wildfire season as part of a research project on the health risks associated with wildfire smoke.“Having first-hand experience living through an extreme weather event gave me more perspective on the need for air quality monitoring,” Durkin said. “This project taught me a lot, and I enjoyed the community engagement aspects of my work.”Durkin was recognized this month as the 2019 Outstanding Undergraduate student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).During her two months living and working in the area, Durkin was part of a research team placing low-cost air monitors around the Methow Valley to gather data on air quality.She gathered and analyzed data from the monitors and interviewed people living near the monitors to learn about how they used the air monitoring network during the wildfire event. Her work was part of a research project led by her faculty advisers, Nicole Errett and Tania Busch Isaksen, both DEOHS lecturers.She also partnered with the Methow Valley Clean Air Project to help educate residents on which areas suffered from the worst air quality and how to stay healthy as wildfire smoke blanketed the region.""Amanda played a critical role in establishing a community air monitoring network in the Methow Valley area,"" Errett said. ""Because of her energy, enthusiasm and hard work, Methow Valley residents now have important air quality information they can use to inform decisions that impact their health.""In addition to her research work, Durkin spent one day a week assisting the county health department with public health services, including food inspections, water quality testing and permits for wells.Back on campus, she works as an occupational health and safety intern for UW Environmental Health and Safety, conducting inspections across campus that focused on occupational safety.Durkin is also working with the research team to submit results from the wildfire project for publication.“I have always been a hard worker,” Durkin said. “It is great to be recognized for my academic achievements. I feel like it is the cherry on top of completing this program.”Durkin moved across the country to attend the UW in part because of its competitive rowing program.She has been a coxswain on the Husky women’s rowing team for the past four years, notching three PAC-12 championships and recognition as part of the PAC-12 All-Academic Team in 2017 and 2018. She will compete June 2 at the national championship for the first time.Durkin credits her UW peers, professors and teammates with teaching her how to build lasting relationships and make the most of the opportunities that have come her way.She chose to pursue her BS in Environmental Health because of a long-time fascination with the interaction between human health and the environment.“We are so dependent on the earth for our survival,” Durkin said. “But yet we pay little attention to how we treat the planet. I wanted to study environmental health to help be part of the solution.”Durkin is currently applying for jobs in occupational health, hoping to work in a community setting. Eventually, she can see herself in a nonprofit or academic setting and potentially pursuing an MBA degree to gain additional leadership skills.“I think a strength and weakness of mine is that I am interested in so many different things,” Durkin said. “Whatever field I end up pursuing, I want to continue to grow as a strong woman driven in her career.”Durkin's research was supported by the department's Environmental Health Research Experience Program: NIEHS grant #4R25ES021646-05."
"May 20, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Omenn award winner,"Shoreline, WAWorking on air pollution and climate change issues at the state or local level.“The remarkable support I received from DEOHS faculty, staff and students made all the difference in my experience at the UW.”- ANNIE DOUBLEDAYWith several weeks still to go before she graduates from the University of Washington, Annie Doubleday already has earned a reputation as a prolific researcher and author with an unusual breadth of skills spanning both environmental and occupational health.Doubleday, a Master of Public Health student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), is listed as the lead author on five research articles that are published or in progress.Now she is adding one more accolade to her CV: Doubleday was recognized this month as winner of the Gilbert S. Omenn Award for Academic Excellence by the UW School of Public Health.“Students like Annie are indeed rare,” said her DEOHS faculty adviser, Tania Busch Isaksen. “She represents the very best we have to offer in the School of Public Health. I know she will make a tremendous impact in the field of environmental public health.”The Omenn award, given by faculty in the UW School of Public Health, recognizes contributions to public health, commitment to community engagement and leadership potential.Doubleday’s research with Busch Isaksen focused on the health effects associated with wildfire smoke. Doubleday conducted a statewide epidemiological analysis examining the association between mortality and wildfire smoke exposure.As part of her interdisciplinary research approach, she worked with atmospheric scientists, air pollution modelers, toxicologists and epidemiologists across state agencies.“The opportunity to collaborate with government agency staff was an important learning experience for me and has been valuable to both my professional and personal development,” Doubleday said.Her thesis work resulted in the first Pacific Northwest study on mortality associated with exposure to wildfire smoke and led to presentations at the state and national levels. State and local government agencies will use her research to inform risk communication efforts during future wildfire seasons.“None of this would have been possible without the support of Tania and other DEOHS faculty and staff,” she said.Doubleday didn’t stop there. She also worked with several other DEOHS mentors to take on research projects focused on the changing burden of workplace exposures in the Pacific Northwest region, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on physical activity and other public health aspects of climate change. Her advisers praise her research abilities, writing and communication skills and data management and analysis.“Annie stands out as one of the most thoughtful, resourceful and talented students I have encountered,” said Marissa Baker, deputy director of the Northwest Center for Occupational Health & Safety. “Her work is not only of high quality but also of high impact on public health.”Doubleday also worked as a teaching assistant for the undergraduate Introduction to Environmental Health course and served as a graduate student representative for the department’s MPH Oversight Committee.She said teaching helped her build skills in working with students one-on-one, as well as in communicating public health concepts to a wider audience.“Through my thesis work, I had the opportunity to work on an interdisciplinary team,” Doubleday said. “I learned how to work effectively with a diverse group, as well as develop my communication and presentation skills.”Doubleday is currently job-hunting, hoping to work in state or local government on issues related to air pollution and climate change."
"May 16, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Protecting precarious workers,"UW DEOHS faculty and research will help inform state policy as part of several bills passed by the Washington State Legislature this spring:A UW student’s internship with the Washington State Legislature this spring helped pave the way for new labor policies that could protect some of the state’s most vulnerable workers.Trevor Peckham, a doctoral student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), studies temporary workers and others in “precarious” employment arrangements.During his recent internship with state Sen. Karen Keiser (D-Kent), he shared research and recommendations about health and safety issues that temp workers face. Keiser, who chairs the Senate Labor & Commerce Committee, said she now intends to propose legislation next year to address these concerns.“You have to have facts...to make good choices,” Keiser said. Peckham’s work “helped me to focus better on what kinds of policy choices we can make to protect temporary workers.”We recently asked Peckham to reflect on his opportunity to help shape state policy—and how scientists can help bridge the gap between science and public policy.Precarious work is basically insecure and unstable employment with limited benefits or protections. This concept is often used to describe the ongoing shift away from “standard” employment (full-time, ongoing employment for one employer).Some call it the “gig economy,” in which workers are increasingly considered independent contractors rather than employees. There are many types of non-standard jobs, such as part-time, temporary or on-call work.Overall, we are talking about millions of workers nationwide, such as construction workers, janitors, health care workers and many others.Workers in these non-standard jobs typically have fewer employee rights, lower wages and more instability than regular workers. The new realities of work require new ways of thinking about how we keep all types of workers safe on the job.For example, we know that temporary agency workers in Washington face twice the risk of on-the-job injury compared to permanent workers. That may be because they have less training, are less familiar with worksite hazards, are assigned to high-hazard tasks or are reluctant to exercise their rights regarding working conditions.Often, there is confusion over who is responsible for worker health and safety when two different employers are involved. The temporary staffing agency hires and manages the worker. The host employer controls the working conditions. There may be very limited communication between them, and the worker can be left unprotected.Additionally, these types of employment arrangements can be used by host employers to avoid financial liability for worker injuries, creating a perverse incentive not to invest in safe working conditions.It’s also worth noting that traditionally marginalized populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, women and lower-educated and lower-skilled workers, tend to be overrepresented in non-standard employment, including temp agency work.The internship made me realize there is a massive policy vacuum around these workers. Worker health and safety issues are very compelling for lawmakers and other stakeholders, but this issue was not really on their radar.With support from Sen. Keiser and her staff, I helped organize a work session with state lawmakers that included testimony by labor advocates, staffing agencies and state experts on health and safety issues for temp workers.And I developed a report with recommendations on different policy solutions, including regulating the kinds of work temp workers can be hired to do or requiring more communication among the host employer, the staffing agency and the worker.I really believe we have a duty as scientists to help close the gap between the research we do and the positive impact it can have on people's lives and livelihoods.My research isn’t just about labor market trends. It is connected to many related issues—social justice, wealth inequality, worker protections, public health, to name a few.As scientists, I think we must do a better job of highlighting these issues for policymakers. When we frame our work in terms of how it affects real people, that resonates with them. No worker should die or get hurt on the job—that’s something everyone can agree on.[laughing] …. I think I’ll leave elected office to the professionals for now, though I look forward to future opportunities to serve as a bridge between policy and science."

"May 14, 2019 | Starre Vartan",Fighting dengue with data,"Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaAssistant professor at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.“If I was going to spend this much time on a research project, I wanted to dedicate it to an area that doesn’t get as much attention.”- KHOLOOD ALTASSANKholood Altassan knew that she wanted to improve the health of people in her home country of Saudi Arabia even before she figured out exactly how.“There’s less public health infrastructure there. That’s what got me most excited—that there’s so much that could be done,” she said. Altassan is being recognized this month as the 2019 Outstanding PhD student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).After graduating from medical school at King Saud University and earning a Master’s in Public Health at George Washington University in 2013, Altassan realized she wanted to do more research in infectious diseases and microbiology.She began pursuing her PhD at the UW in Environmental and Occupational Hygiene. Still, it felt as if there was a piece missing until she took a DEOHS class on infectious disease and climate change that finally brought it all together for her.Now that she knew what she wanted to do, Altassan next had to find an adviser. Associate Professor Jeremy Hess had just arrived at the UW, too, and he gave the influential lecture on climate change and environmental health to Altassan’s seminar class.“Not a lot of our advisers are willing to work in a foreign country they are not familiar with, but it was really important to me to work in Saudi Arabia,” said Altassen. As a global health researcher, Hess welcomed the challenge.“People try to dissuade you about being stubborn about your idea and suggest latching onto whatever the faculty are already doing,” Altassan said. “But it was a personal thing to me, to do something in my country and to do something useful. Professor Hess supported that.”Altassan had a specific project in mind: The head of Environmental Health in Saudi Arabia told her the country was struggling with dengue fever, a painful, mosquito-borne disease that can cause fever, failure of the circulatory system, massive bleeding and death.“The first outbreak happened in the mid-1990s. Now it’s endemic and getting worse every year,” she said. Altassan wanted to investigate the potential connection between climate change and dengue, an area that had never been studied in Saudi Arabia.“Her work is breaking new ground on multiple fronts,” Hess said: first, by looking at dengue emergence in the Middle East; then, by looking at the potential role of climate change in dengue’s emergence in that part of the world. And finally, by looking at the role of migration in the emergence and persistence of the dengue epidemic there—another little-studied area.Getting the data to begin her research proved to be another challenge.“Data collection isn’t the way it is in the US. Saudi Arabia doesn’t have a lot of widely available data sets, and there was a lot of bureaucracy to get what they did have,” Altassan said.It took a lot of legwork and visits to multiple public health centers in two cities. “I got the information drop-by-drop, year-by-year,” she said.Meanwhile, she had plenty of other work to do while waiting for the numbers to roll in. Altassan trained on new software and tested her data analysis with climate data sets. She ran regression models and put together a literature review paper for publication.Her analysis so far indicates that climate is a factor that’s playing a larger role in the incidence of dengue.Altassan will continue her research, as well as other environmental health projects, when she returns to King Saud University as an assistant professor in the family and community medicine department at the College of Medicine in fall 2019."
"May 9, 2019 | Allegra Abramo",The science of workplace safety,"Industrial hygiene wasn’t on the short list of career choices for Noah Seixas until he got an up-close look at a workplace incident that exposed millions of people to a hazardous chemical.Seixas was an undergraduate student in the 1970s when an internship took him to Michigan following an incident in which a toxic flame retardant was mistakenly mixed with livestock feed. Millions of people ate contaminated meat and dairy products before the mix-up was discovered, causing lingering health effects that are still being investigated today.The experience of working with farmers and their families, who were particularly affected, “was just enormously impressive to me,” Seixas said.It launched him on a long and prominent career that has advanced the science of workplace exposures and contributed to better working conditions in many industries.In May, Seixas will receive the American Industrial Hygiene Association’s prestigious Donald E. Cummings Memorial Award, which recognizes outstanding contributions to the knowledge and practice of industrial hygiene.In his 26 years as a professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, Seixas has investigated the health effects of welding fumes, construction noise, stress among women in the building trades and the ways in which working conditions influence health disparities.The breadth and impact of Seixas’s work inspired Marissa Baker, a DEOHS acting assistant professor, to nominate him for the award. “Noah is extremely committed to a safer and healthier work environment for all workers,” said Baker, who worked in Seixas’s lab before earning her doctorate under his tutelage.Early in his career, Seixas made his mark designing innovative approaches to quantify exposure to chemicals such as coal dust, silica and manganese. His epidemiological study of silica miners, for example, provided the International Agency for Research on Cancer with important evidence to declare silica a lung carcinogen.Seixas also developed a novel approach to estimate construction workers’ noise exposure. By following 250 apprentices for a decade, the study was able to show “the importance of protecting young ears,” Seixas said.After studying injuries among day laborers, Seixas began to think more broadly about the role work plays in people’s well-being. People with lower socioeconomic status tend to have poorer health outcomes, Seixas said.“But what we don’t think about is how work contributes to those disparities.” he said. “As a result, we don’t see work as a place where one can intervene to improve the health of people with lower social status.”In recent years, Seixas helped create a mentoring program for women sheet metal workers who face added on-the-job stress due to discrimination and harassment. The sheet metal workers union now hopes to expand the successful pilot program nationwide.Seixas has influenced the professional paths of hundreds of students over his years in the department, said Martin Cohen, DEOHS senior lecturer and assistant chair who also nominated Seixas for the award.Seixas calls himself “an industrial voyeur” who loves watching how things are made and sharing that passion with his students through visits to industrial workplaces such as a steel plant and a pulp mill.“It blows their minds,” he said. Most have no idea such hazardous working conditions exist in high-tech Seattle. “It turns them on to the importance of the work they are learning to do.”Seixas directs the Northwest Center for Occupational and Health Safety and also serves as chief editor of the Annals of Work Exposures and Health."
"May 2, 2019 | DEOHS Communications",Antibiotic resistance in orcas,"“Anything potentially pathogenic in their bodies is of grave concern.”–MARILYN ROBERTSFor 17 days last summer, the world was riveted by the sight of one of Puget Sound’s southern resident killer whales carrying her dead calf in what seemed like an act of mourning before finally letting the calf go.The tragedy focused new attention on the three endangered orca pods that live along the inner waters of Washington and British Columbia. Since 2015, none of their calves has survived.“There were 98 whales in the pods in 1995,” said Marilyn Roberts, professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). “Now we’re down to 78.”Roberts is among the authors of newly published research showing that orcas can carry antibiotic-resistant, potentially pathogenic strains of E. coli, ST73 and ST127, that may come from their environment or food.While more research is needed to determine if this is causing disease that could contribute to the orcas’ decline, “anything potentially pathogenic in their bodies is of grave concern,” Roberts said.Previous research suggested that exhaled whale breath contained potentially pathogenic bacteria, but no one had ever looked for Escherichia coli in this critically endangered species.Roberts, who specializes in antibiotic resistance, and Daira Melendez, DEOHS master’s student in Environmental Health, used whole genome sequencing to analyze nine E.coli samples isolated from the resident pods’ fecal samples.The research was funded in part by the UW Center for One Health Research, housed in DEOHS.To collect the samples, trained rescue dogs went out on boats in the Salish Sea. The dogs can smell orca feces from as far away as a nautical mile. Samples were collected and centrifuged into small pellets on the boat and then taken back to the lab for genome analysis.The researchers only expected to find one antibiotic-resistant gene. “Instead, we identified three and segments of a fourth,” said Melendez. In people, these strains cause urinary tract disease. But it’s not yet known what they do to whales.The Salish Sea is full of pollutants: Previous research has found antibiotic residue around sewer treatment discharge and in wild Chinook salmon in the area.“This research highlights the importance of One Health and the interrelationship between human, animal and environmental health,” Melendez said. “The orcas act as sentinels for the health of the Salish Sea—and the effects of pollution caused by humans on marine life.”Further research is needed to determine if the whales, as apex predators, acquired E. coli from their diet or directly from the water, the researchers said.Earlier this year, the Washington State Legislature passed a package of bills that would regulate products containing chemicals that are harmful to the whales as well as reduce noise pollution and change fish catch limits.“We’re desperately trying to save the population,” Roberts said, pointing to discussions of breaching dams on the Snake River. “But we don’t even know what’s causing the decline. Is it that they’re starving, or is it contaminants?”Since the 1950s, antibiotic resistance in people has risen sharply. So perhaps it's no surprise that researchers are finding a similar increase in our environment.Much of the resident whales’ territory intersects urbanized environments, including the large metropolitan areas of Seattle, Bellingham and Vancouver. “Wherever animals interact with people, they share pathogens,” Roberts said.But the effect may be even more widespread than we realize.Researchers studying marine mammals in Antarctica also found E.coli strains ST73 and ST127, resistant to ampicillin, among other drugs. When you compare newer strains of E.coli to older strains, “you find much more drug resistance,” Roberts said.Co-authors on the paper include DEOHS Professor Peter Rabinowitz and DEOHS Research Scientist David No; Alexander Greninger, UW School of Medicine; Scott Weissman, Seattle Children’s; and Samuel Wasser, UW Department of Biology."
"April 29, 2019 | Lynn Schnaiberg",“What are they getting exposed to out there?”,"J.C. Harris lives on a cul-de-sac directly in the flight path of Sea-Tac International Airport’s third runway. For Harris, a University of Washington study analyzing air traffic’s impact on air quality in communities near and below Sea-Tac flight paths is far from academic.The 58-year-old is concerned about the health effects on his neighborhood of increased flight volume at Sea-Tac, one of the nation’s fastest-growing airports.“There’s a line of schools in the path of runway one where kids are out playing,” said Harris, a longtime Des Moines resident. “So what are they getting exposed to out there?”Edmund Seto, associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), says community concerns like these led state lawmakers to commission a two-year study led by a team of UW researchers called the Mobile ObserVations of Ultrafine Particles study.Seto is the study’s co-principal investigator along with Timothy Larson, professor in DEOHS and in the UW Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering.The communities around Sea-Tac airport are not alone in their concerns about aircraft emissions.Last week, US Congressman Adam Smith (D-WA) reintroduced a bill to establish a national study on the health effects of ultrafine particles around airport communities, including those in Seattle. The DEOHS study could help inform the legislation.DEOHS researchers are measuring the geographic reach of aircraft-related air pollution exposures, distinguishing ultrafine particle emissions from aircraft versus those from cars and trucks.They are also studying ultrafine particle levels in areas with high air traffic compared with areas not impacted by flights. Researchers expect to share initial findings this summer, with final results expected in December.To Seto’s knowledge, this is the first study to systematically track aircraft-related air pollution in the communities around Sea-Tac, monitoring within 10 miles of the airport in the direction of flight paths.It’s also one of the first to disentangle aircraft- versus road-related ultrafine particle emissions.UW researchers worked on an earlier Los Angeles International Airport study that found aircraft landings produced ultrafine particle pollution roughly equivalent to LA’s freeway network.That pollution negatively impacted air quality much farther (over a 23-square-mile area that extended 10 miles downwind) than reported in prior airport studies. Seto said early analysis of data collected in the Sea-Tac study suggest there are elevated ultrafine particle levels along aircraft pathways.Ultrafine particle exposure has been linked with adverse cardiovascular and respiratory health effects (and even possibly the risk of dementia). Yet the US Environmental Protection Agency does not routinely monitor ultrafine particle air pollution, Seto said.The study isn’t designed to capture health effects, but it lays the foundation for future health studies. It also has sparked a UW proposal to design and evaluate new air filters for personal use or for buildings that might help reduce exposures to particles associated with aircraft.The filters would make possible new studies that could demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between the particles associated with aircraft emissions and short-term, acute health effects like inflammation and respiratory impacts.For Seto, the study is “addressing on-the-ground needs with actionable research.”Communities around Sea-Tac have shaped the research in concrete ways. The initial study design included mobile monitoring only (a cost-effective approach where researchers drive air monitoring equipment to myriad locations) and only during daytime hours. Community feedback led researchers to add monitoring at fixed sites, allowing the team to gather data day and night.Community input also encouraged researchers to include Federal Aviation Administration flight data to analyze the relationship between ultrafine particle counts and flight traffic volume and patterns—important because of concern over increased flights in this region, Seto said.“It’s about measuring in the right place at the right time under conditions people think are most representative of the issue,” he said.Bottom line, Seto said: “When we’ve heard from residents, it’s often framed from an environmental justice perspective—why are flights concentrated over certain communities and not others?""Those communities are asking legitimate questions about how this translates into differences in exposures and impacts and how health outcomes might be related to aircraft emissions, he said.Harris hopes the study and its baseline data will help spur regular public monitoring of ultrafine particles—and a study of what the numbers mean for the health of impacted communities.“I want us all to be able to see the air-quality impact of the number of flights growing and flight patterns changing,” he said. “I want transparency.”"
"April 25, 2019 | Jeff Hodson",The human-animal bond,"The UW Center for One Health Research is seeking new funding sources to sustain and expand the clinic. Make a gift: https://deohs.washington.edu/cohr/donateWashington’s two largest public universities—longtime rivals on the sports field—are teaming up off the field on a new project to improve the health of young adults experiencing homelessness and their pets.The University of Washington and Washington State University are partnering with two Seattle agencies to launch the One Health Clinic, providing one-stop health care and veterinary care to this vulnerable population.Key partners are the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) in the School of Public Health, WSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine, UW Medicine, Neighborcare Health and New Horizons Ministries.A deep bond exists between many homeless youth and their companion animals, with owners often putting the health needs of their pets ahead of their own.That creates an opportunity to provide health care services for a hard-to-reach population, said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, DEOHS professor and director of UW’s Center for One Health Research based at DEOHS.“Our joint human health/veterinary care model allows us to treat humans and their pets as a unit since there are so many overlapping health issues,” said Rabinowitz, also a professor of family medicine in the UW School of Medicine and of global health in the Department of Global Health.“The aim of this project is to determine the best way to integrate human and animal medical care for people facing homelessness and their pets and to leverage positive aspects of the human-animal bond.”The project grew out of a pilot grant from the UW’s Population Health Initiative. Rabinowitz reached across the state to bring in enthusiastic colleagues at WSU.The partnership comes amid a statewide campaign by the UW and WSU to promote the affordability and impact of public higher education.“For those people experiencing homelessness, companion animals can provide comfort and friendship,"" said Bryan K. Slinker, Dean of WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine. ""At the One Health Clinic, veterinary and human health students work side by side with their preceptors and community providers to serve these vulnerable animal and human pairs in a truly interprofessional model of care."" The One Health Clinic is now open up to two nights per month at New Horizons, a shelter and service provider for youth in downtown Seattle. Neighborcare Health is the human medical provider at the clinic.The clinic can serve up to seven client-pairs each night. WSU veterinary students work alongside UW medical, nursing and social work students, including members of University District Street Medicine, a student-run volunteer organization.The One Health clinic could eventually expand to Ballard and could include a mobile clinic, but Rabinowitz says sustainable funding is needed.In addition to providing direct health services, Rabinowitz said Center for One Health researchers are studying the impact of having a companion animal on the physical and mental health of people facing homelessness.The center, which explores linkages among humans, animals and their shared environment, aims to provide research-based recommendations for combined health care, he said."
"April 22, 2019 | Sarah Stanley",Traffic pollution and dementia,"How much traffic-related air pollution are you exposed to every year in Seattle?UW researchers will drive tens of thousands of miles this year along a meticulously mapped route through Seattle to answer that question. (In a hybrid vehicle, of course.)When combined with medical records, the data they collect from this innovative mobile-monitoring strategy could reveal whether long-term exposure to traffic pollutants increases the risk of dementia.“Traffic pollutants are historically understudied compared to other air pollutants,” said Magali Blanco, a PhD student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). “We don't fully understand the extent of their impact on long-term health because the data are very limited.""Blanco and her UW School of Public Health colleagues are using specially designed mobile monitoring equipment mounted on vehicles to gather air samples at 300 off-road locations around Seattle. They will also collect on-road data while driving between these locations.Last month, trained drivers began initial visits to each location, which are representative of where participants in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study live. ACT is a long-running UW-Kaiser Permanente study of aging.At each stop, the driver pulls over for two minutes while instruments in the car measure levels of gases and particulates associated with traffic, such as ultrafine particles, black carbon and nitrogen dioxide.By 2020, each stop will have been sampled about 30 times during different seasons, days of the week and times of day—more than 9,000 samples in all for this aspect of the study.In addition, the monitoring equipment will collect data continuously during each drive, creating a massive trove of air pollution data that can be used in this and future health studies.“People breathe air all day, every day, but other mobile studies typically only drive in daylight on weekdays,” said Lianne Sheppard, DEOHS professor and co-principal investigator on the project with Gail Li, professor in the UW Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.“This is the first study of its kind with a very intentional design focused on epidemiology.”A growing body of research suggests that exposure to traffic-related ultrafine particles may raise the risk of dementia, either by entering the brain directly from the bloodstream or by causing systemic inflammation.Taking past traffic patterns into account, researchers will project this year’s mobile monitoring results back in time. The analysis will reveal long-term exposure to traffic pollutants according to where people live.Then, the final step: Scientists will incorporate data from the ACT study to see whether dementia rates are higher among people who live in areas with higher exposure to those pollutants.“If we find any meaningful connections, that will contribute to the body of evidence that can be used to make policy changes to protect public health,” Sheppard said.“I am really pleased that the long-standing ACT study now has the opportunity to contribute to research on air pollution,"" said Dr. Eric B Larson, the study's founder and executive director of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. ""Our participants have been particularly willing to volunteer for this project, indicative of the great public interest in the effect of air pollution on health.” Researchers anticipate that the new data and the novel design of the mobile-monitoring study will inform future epidemiological research.“This project is an interesting mix of big data, data science and exposure science,” Blanco said. “People are excited about it because we are collecting a lot of data that could help answer many different questions.”The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency is among those interested in the outcomes of the ACT study.“This study will contribute to the broader body of scientific knowledge on the full range of health impacts from air pollution,” said Kathy Strange, a DEOHS graduate and the agency’s air quality programs director.Information from the study will complement data gathered from the agency’s air pollution monitoring network, which includes sensors at several of the 300 stops chosen for the new study.Data from these sensors and others maintained by the Washington State Department of Ecology will help validate the mobile measurements—ultimately, painting a more complete picture of pollutant concentrations across the Puget Sound area."
"April 17, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Opioids and injured workers,"Washington is considered a national leader in efforts to reduce prescription drug overdose, thanks in part to changes in opioid prescribing practices championed by Dr. Gary Franklin.Franklin is a research professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences and medical director for the state Department of Labor & Industries.The event is free, and no registration is required. Can’t attend in person? Like us on Facebook, then tune in to Facebook Live to watch the event.On Wednesday, April 24, Franklin will be the keynote speaker at the UW’s annual Worker Memorial Day event honoring workers who died from workplace injuries or illnesses in King County.We talked with Franklin about his groundbreaking opioid research and why collaboration is key to stemming the tide of opioid addiction.We have reversed the trend. In Washington, we’ve seen a 60 percent decline in deaths related to prescription opioids thanks to a number of new, collaboratively developed approaches.The mid- to late 2000s were the heyday of overly permissive prescribing. Our research found that a worker getting at least two opioid prescriptions or more than a week’s supply in the first six weeks after injury doubled their risk of being disabled a year later.Opioids alone―even apart from the injury―led many workers to become disabled.So we devised new state workers’ compensation rules that said if you get opioids for an injury and your pain and function isn’t better after six weeks, we would stop covering further opioid prescriptions.Between 2007 and 2017, the number of workers who got at least one opioid prescription and went on to long-term opioid use dropped from 7.5 percent to less than 1 percent.For a long time, it was framed as a patient abuse issue. The truth is that opioids were being falsely marketed by drug companies as safe and unlikely to cause addiction.Doctors were taught a lot of falsehoods, like there’s no ceiling on the dose or that the way to treat drug tolerance is to increase the dose. It made doctors more comfortable than they should have been in overprescribing opioids for routine pain.In 2005, we reported the nation’s first deaths from prescription opioids. By 2007, Washington had introduced the first prescription guidelines for doctors that set dosing thresholds.And by 2010, our research showed that those guidelines were beginning to reduce deaths and reduce the number of new injured workers transitioning to chronic opioid use.We’ve addressed the issue on the front end regarding better prescribing practices. What we have left is all the damage that’s already been done, with tens of thousands of Washington residents now dependent on or addicted to opioids.Now we are left with the challenge of developing better ways to care for pain and to address dependence and addiction.We’re trying figure out how to help them. Nobody actually knows how to do that yet, but we are actively working with collaborators to find the answers.Collaboration will be the key, and Washington wouldn’t be where we are today without it, and without the support of successive governors and legislatures.State agencies have worked together for years to develop evidence-based policies and solutions. That includes the state Health Care Authority, the state departments of Labor & Industries, Health, Corrections and many other partners.I don’t know of any other state where agencies are formally partnering to address the opioid epidemic. I feel optimistic that we will identify solutions together."
"April 16, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Giving voice to vulnerable communities,"Two undergraduate students in the University of Washington School of Public Health are being honored as part of this year’s Husky 100 based on their work with the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health (PNASH) Center at the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences.Mattawa, WAPursue a Master’s in Health Services.“I came to the UW to learn how to better serve communities and help them find their voice.”Idanis Cruz and Art Aguilar will graduate in June with degrees in Public Health-Global Health from the UW School of Public Health. Each year, the UW honors 100 undergraduate and graduate students who make the most of their time at the UW, using their classroom skills to have real-world impact.Cruz was born in Mexico and moved to the US at age 7. As a child, she worked alongside her parents doing agricultural work. Her firsthand experience with health and safety issues facing agricultural workers led her to study public health.“Because I grew up in the agricultural community, I am familiar with their needs and how to best communicate with them,” Cruz said. “Farmworkers actually know a lot about pesticide safety and their health needs but don’t always have a platform to share ideas. Doing a community needs assessment is one way to give farmworkers that platform.”Cruz works as a student assistant for the PNASH Center, giving her the opportunity to work with faculty and staff to address issues close to her heart.El Paso, TXWork as a community advocate on community design, sustainable agriculture and human rights.“I am thankful for all of the people I worked with at the UW who motivated and inspired me to always do my best.”Recently, she worked on a bilingual pesticide safety app that delivers safety information in Spanish and English. She also works on a project to assess what resources farmworkers need to stay healthy and safe during wildfire season.Cruz excels at anticipating barriers and analyzing issues, raising challenging questions and finding creative solutions, said Kit Galvin, PNASH research scientist and Cruz’s mentor. She is “a positive, thoughtful and mature member of the research team and helped carry the pesticide safety app project far beyond my expectations.”Aguilar focused his UW studies on community engagement. He learned the importance of understanding the needs of vulnerable communities to help them find their voices through his work with PNASH and a capstone project with the homeless community in Seattle.“Providing a one-size-fits-all solution to resolving community public health problems can be detrimental to those that fall outside conventional boundaries,” Aguilar said.Aguilar’s grandparents were agricultural workers. From an early age, he was drawn to finding ways to help that community.He was selected for the Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences in Environmental Health (SURE-EH) program administered by DEOHS, focusing his research on how migrant student engagement could benefit agricultural health and safety.He helped design a curriculum for high school students to educate and empower youth to understand and address health issues faced by agricultural workers. He also worked with a group of students and faculty to conduct outreach and a needs assessment to help reduce farmworker exposure to heat and pesticides in Central Washington.PNASH Program Manager Marcy Harrington noted that Aguilar brings a lot of curiosity and drive to his work. “He really works to understand an issue well, especially from the point of view of the people most impacted.”Cruz plans to continue working for PNASH after graduation and also hopes to work for Sea Mar Community Health Centers. She would like to get a Master’s in Health Services that will help her “become the person who turns evidence into real-world impact.”“One of the biggest things I have learned in the School of Public Health is the importance of public engagement and ensuring you understand what the community truly needs and wants,” she said.Aguilar remains interested in working with vulnerable populations. “Sometimes decision-makers do not take into account diverse community perspectives, and I plan to advocate for this throughout my career.”"
"April 16, 2019 | Ashlie Chandler",Exploring a scientific frontier,"Fort Wayne, IndianaContinue working on research to improve how we prevent disease and promote well-being.“I love public health because it goes beyond scientific discovery and pushes us to use what is discovered for a greater purpose.”For Joe Dempsey, summers in Fort Wayne, Indiana meant one thing: baseball.He and other neighborhood kids would find an empty lot, choose sides and improvise rules based on the number of players and the equipment available, playing until dark.“The smell of fresh-cut grass still reminds me of summer,” says Dempsey, now a doctoral student in environmental toxicology in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), part of the School of Public Health.This month, Dempsey was named the School’s 2019-20 Magnuson Scholar. He is one of six students from the UW Health Sciences schools who will receive $30,000 each for their education.Sandlot ball taught Dempsey many lessons: dedication to learn the fundamentals; diplomacy to keep every player happy; imagination to think up different ways to play the game; and inquisitiveness to solve problems without adult supervision.Now Dempsey is bringing this same creativity and curiosity to a different sort of sandlot. He is exploring the gut microbiome—what some have called “a scientific frontier”—to understand how this highly complex ecosystem shapes human health and disease. The gut microbiome is the name given to all the microbes, fungi and viruses, along with their genetic material, that live in the intestine.Our gut microbiota contain tens of trillions of microorganisms, including several hundred different species of known bacteria with more than three million genes. This ecosystem can affect everything from our weight and allergic responses to our mental health.“There is so much we still don't know about the gut microbiome,” said Dempsey, who received his MPH from Indiana University Bloomington. “We need to think outside the box because we’re trying to imagine something beyond what is known, what is possible.”Over the past decade, scientists have identified the gut microbiome as an important factor involved in obesity. Additionally, changes in the composition of gut microbiota have been linked to heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s. Some speculate that if the microbiome is adjusted, it could decrease the risk for Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis or diabetes.What is less understood is how environmental exposures early in life can affect the gut microbiome and increase a person’s risk for these health outcomes. This is where Dempsey’s dissertation work comes in.He is looking at how the gut microbiome and the liver develop together over time. The liver is typically the primary site of detoxification; however, the gut and its associated microbes play an important role in filtering and detoxifying materials not meant to be in the body.He is also testing to see how early exposure to environmental toxicants and drugs might alter microbial communities in ways that could impact health later in life.To do this, he uses both conventional mouse models (those that have a microbiome) and germ-free models (those that don’t have any bacteria). All of his work is done alongside his mentor Julia (Yue) Cui, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, and other researchers in her lab.“I feel that it is truly a blessing to work with Joe,” Cui said. “He is a highly motivated, ambitious and hard-working student who has already demonstrated great potential on the path to becoming a successful researcher and educator.”Dempsey’s lab studies and the work of several other research groups have shown that the presence of certain bacteria in the gut can impact our body’s ability to metabolize toxic chemicals or drugs.The research focuses on an enzyme called cytochrome P450 3A4, which oxidizes small foreign molecules so they can be removed from the body.“If certain bacteria are there, the expression of these enzymes could be really high, which means they're going to metabolize drugs and environmental chemicals at a higher rate,” Dempsey explained. “If the bacteria aren't there, the expression of these enzymes is a lot lower, so they are not going to metabolize these drugs very efficiently.”This finding, among other research, pokes holes in the belief that all bacteria are dangerous. For centuries, humans have drawn a strong link between bacteria and illness, and for good reason. Deadly outbreaks from the bubonic plague to tuberculosis can all be traced back to these adaptive microorganisms.However, mounting evidence has shown that the bacteria that make up our gut microbiome are crucial to our survival. The ultimate goal, according to Dempsey, is to show that certain bacteria are producing a therapeutic effect in humans.“If we can do this, we would be able to target these specific bacteria in order to alleviate a certain condition,” he said. “Imagine a magic, natural pill of a bacteria that produces a metabolite that could prevent obesity or reduce diabetes risk.”This sort of research takes a lot of ingenuity and often requires scientists like Dempsey to make wild theories, only to try to disprove them.When he has a creative block, Dempsey puts everything down and goes for a walk outside. In fact, Dempsey tries to spend as much time outdoors as possible. He enjoys going on runs, hiking and playing recreational sports.Dempsey was voted by SPH students as the Outstanding Teaching Assistant last year. He is known for using environmental themes from popular culture, including Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax,” to illustrate classroom lessons.As a graduate research assistant in the Cui lab, Dempsey provides guidance to several undergraduate students.“I like seeing the understanding in a student when they finally get it,” he said. “It’s a good feeling to know that a student understands something and that they can pass the knowledge on to someone else, especially in this public health field, where communicating about what you’re doing is so important.”"
"April 11, 2019 | Rebecca Yost",Hooked on STEM,"What’s the best way to get young women hooked on a career in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM)? Iron Man, of course.Students in Highline Public Schools south of Seattle recently got an up-close look at new exoskeleton technology designed to reduce musculoskeletal risk factors for workers.The event was part of an ongoing partnership between the school district and the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Students at the district’s annual STEM Fest took measurements to calculate how effective the technology was in reducing muscle strain for workers performing overhead work.“I could see this technology being helpful for my dad,” one student said. “He works in painting and roofing. He does a lot of work with his arms raised above his head and complains of getting tired.”Nancy Simcox, DEOHS lecturer and director of Continuing Education programs, worked with DEOHS staff member Sarah Wolz and partners from the state Department of Labor & Industries to encourage young women to consider how a STEM career might allow them to design similar innovations.“Examining the intersection of science and social justice is a powerful way for students to be inspired to pursue a career in STEM, and because of [our] phenomenal partners, ... students can realize it is an option for them, too,” Michelle Thomassian of Highline Public Schools.Read more about the STEM Fest event here."
"April 4, 2019 | Starre Vartan",Eliminating TB,"Tuberculosis is pernicious.At first, a person infected with TB bacteria may think it’s a bad cold. Several weeks could go by before the patient goes to the doctor.“It’s during those weeks when people are spreading the disease to family and colleagues,” said Professor Gerard Cangelosi of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Cutting the time between TB infection and treatment is the goal of Cangelosi’s research on a new oral swab test to detect TB more easily, at lower risk and at lower cost than the current approach.Now, the results are in from the first large human study of the new method.A recently published paper by Cangelosi and his research team in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology found that the oral swab method can be as accurate as existing diagnostic tests that are more expensive, more invasive and potentially more dangerous for health workers.Using oral swabs to test for TB could be a game-changer, particularly in settings with few health care resources and for children and other patients who can’t be effectively tested using current methods.A major report published last month by The Lancet found that investing in new diagnostic approaches will be an essential part of ending TB within a generation.Cangelosi recently received a $1.3 million, 4-year grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue his work on the oral swab approach. His team will spend 2019 optimizing and validating oral swab analysis, then evaluate the method during additional human trials in South Africa, where TB is endemic.“This approach could facilitate point-of-care diagnostic strategies and greatly simplify the care of patients,” Cangelosi said. “It could also facilitate active case-finding strategies, leading to reduced TB transmission and a new tool in the global fight to end TB.”The current gold standard for TB diagnosis—sputum analysis—is complicated and messy.Sputum sample quality varies widely, and when patients cough up sputum from deep in their lungs to provide a sample, health care workers and other patients can be exposed to airborne TB.“Basically, sputum is a horrible sample. It’s hard to manipulate, it’s not a homogenous sample, there’s not much TB in there in the first place, and patients hate giving them,” explained David Boyle, DEOHS affiliate associate professor and TB researcher who was not involved in the study.It was a situation ripe for a rethink.Cangelosi’s oral swab test relies on two quick tongue swabs instead. The sample can be collected in just seconds. The test is noninvasive, painless and doesn’t produce airborne bacteria.A swab test “is a nicer method and could lend itself to automation, too,” Boyle said. He envisions the new test integrating into existing lab analysis equipment so that health care systems in low-resource setting would not need expensive new equipment.“Some adaptations will be necessary, but we believe that [the swab samples] will work in the current analysis machines,” Cangelosi said.Eventually, Cangelosi hopes the test can be used in schools, factories, prisons, hospitals and other locations with large groups of people where TB may be lurking to identify cases earlier and get people into treatment faster.Cangelosi got the idea for an oral swab from Lisa Jones-Engel, a UW biological anthropologist who has successfully tested primates with the method since 2000.Since “monkeys don’t spit,” said Jones-Engel, her team needed a way to test for TB without using sputum. A colleague, Alicia Wilbur, turned her onto the idea of a cheek-swab test, which could be taken from the macaque monkeys she was studying when they were trapped and anesthetized to collect other data.“This all started with two anthropologists and a bunch of monkeys,” said Jones-Engel. “Jerry was the first person in the human TB world to say ‘Huh, there’s something to this,’ and he had the desire and ability to take this and run with it.”Authors on the new research paper include Cangelosi; Jones-Engel; collaborators from the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative and the University of Cape Town, South Africa; and DEOHS researchers Rachel Wood, Felicia Nguyen, Alaina Olson and Kris Weigel."

You will support award-winning students like Rachel Shaffer, a doctoral student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) with a passion for civic engagement whose research is already informing public policies that protect human health and the environment.Shaffer’s research includes investigating the effects of food additives on children’s health; the link between a form of cancer and glyphosate, the world’s most widely used weed killer; and working with her faculty adviser, DEOHS Professor Lianne Sheppard, to study the connection between air pollution and Alzheimer’s disease,Shaffer, who is earning her PhD in Environmental Toxicology, spoke about her research and the impact of receiving the Endowed Fellowship from the UW School of Public Health (SPH).I was drawn to the PhD program in toxicology that is within the broad and diverse DEOHS, which itself is housed in a strong School of Public Health.I want to understand the biology of what happens when we are exposed to pollutants and then use this expertise to help drive policies that are protective of human health and the environment.I’m deeply concerned about the impact of environmental exposures on human and ecological health, but there is only so much that individuals can do to protect themselves. Real progress can only come through systemic change to prevent the use and release of toxic chemicals.Working in public environmental health allows me to do interdisciplinary research that can be applied to upstream policies that reduce risk and prevent disease. I also hope that these policies will have similar, simultaneous benefits on ecological and planetary health.I want to help translate information to the public and to policymakers so that the results of environmental health research can improve health outcomes. That includes raising awareness of the impact of pollutants on human health because many people are unaware that chemicals in everyday products may pose risks. You can read more about my work on my blog, RachelTalksTox.I’m extremely grateful to the donors for establishing this award and very honored to have received this recognition from SPH. I plan to use this fellowship money to make it a little easier to live in this expensive city and also, specifically, for travel to conferences related to my interdisciplinary interests.I hope to use my environmental health expertise to pursue a career in regulatory environmental health and science policy. I also plan to continue to use my science communication skills to raise awareness and help promote positive change."
"April 1, 2019 | Ashlie Chandler",Learning comes to life,"Erica Grant climbed the steep lava slopes of Rwanda’s volcanic park and trekked through its dense rain forest to see some of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas.What surprised her most wasn’t so much the great apes themselves, but how difficult it was for tourists to keep a safe distance away.This was an ideal setting for Grant as an MPH student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), where she studied One Health, an approach that recognizes the multidirectional health linkages of humans, animals and the environment. Grant is among thousands of SPH students who have gained valuable skills through life-changing experiences in the field.In Rwanda, she built a system for tracking data on the health of hundreds of guides, trackers and porters so researchers could better understand how to prevent the spread of pathogens between humans and gorillas.“I value classroom learning, but there’s only so much you can learn in an artificial environment,” says Grant, who graduated from DEOHS in 2018. “At some point, you have to get your boots dirty to really grow.”Read about Erica’s experiences in the field and how the UW School of Public Health promotes opportunities for students to take their classroom learning and apply it in real life."
"March 25, 2019 | Amanda Pain",When social justice meets science,"The contributions his students have made to the field of environmental health.1991“For new faculty, it’s important to focus on the things you really care about, engage with students, develop collaborations and be able to say no because people will ask too much of you.”- RICHARD FENSKERichard Fenske was on his way to becoming a theologian until science intervened.As a graduate student in comparative religion, Fenske became fascinated by the ways in which science challenged religious traditions.“I was very concerned about environmental pollution, and I have a strong commitment to social justice,” said Fenske, professor and associate chair in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). “I saw that environmental health sciences would allow me to generate information and help shape social and environmental policy.”Join us Aug. 7-9 in Seattle. Hear from keynote speaker Richard Fenske at the Western Agricultural Safety & Health Conference.REGISTER TODAYFenske shifted course and earned his PhD in environmental health from the University of California, Berkeley. Now, after a 35-year career that includes 28 years at the UW, Fenske will retire from DEOHS in June.Fenske combined his passions into an academic career filled with groundbreaking accomplishments and a focus on protecting and improving the health of vulnerable people.His research centered on assessing risk and reducing pesticide exposures among farmworkers and children. His major research contributions included pioneering two new exposure methods.The first method uses fluorescent tracer technology to test the effectiveness of protective equipment used by people who mix and apply pesticides. It allows farmworkers to see pesticide residue on their skin and clothing and is now used around the world to highlight—literally—the importance of safe pesticide-handling practices.“Seeing how and where they were exposed helped change workers’ attitudes and behaviors about health and safety,” Fenske said. “To me, this was more powerful than any number of training sessions.”Secondly, Fenske created a package of methods used to assess children’s exposure to pesticides in agricultural environments, combining methods used to measure worker pesticide exposure and lead exposure in homes. This approach has been used and adapted across the globe by researchers, including in several major epidemiological studies.Fenske and his team used these approaches to show that children of Eastern Washington farmworkers had higher exposures to certain pesticides compared to other children.“These studies had a big impact on health and safety practices meant to prevent farmworkers from bringing pesticide residue into their homes,” he said. “I am proud that I have contributed to reducing the risks of pesticide exposures among workers and children through educating and informing the public and policymakers.”In 1996, Fenske co-founded the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center (PNASH), part of DEOHS and one of 11 nationally funded centers that conducts research, education and prevention programs in agricultural industries. Fenske served as center director for 21 years.DEOHS Chair Michael Yost, who became PNASH's director last year, said he and Fenske first met at Berkeley, where Fenske was a teaching assistant in one of Yost's classes. ""He was a meticulous grader who made us better writers with his lengthy comments,"" Yost recalled.""His many contributions to environmental health sciences have improved worker health and the health of families in agricultural communities,” Yost said. During his time at the UW, Fenske also served as chair of the National Academy of Medicine’s Veterans and Agent Orange Committee and was a member of several key advisory committees for the US Environmental Protection Agency. He provided testimony on the health risks of pesticides to Congress and the Washington State Legislature.Fenske served as acting DEOHS chair for a time, and he said he particularly enjoyed his role as the DEOHS graduate program coordinator because it gave him the opportunity to work with students across the department.“What is great about this department is that we have such superb students and so many faculty with diverse expertise and the desire to collaborate to advance research and promote health,” he said."
"March 19, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Relocating for climate change,"Sea-level rise associated with climate change is already displacing some small indigenous communities, and many others are at risk around the world.Prior to catastrophic flooding anticipated in the next few decades, people living in these communities can begin an orderly process of managed retreat, or planned relocation, to higher ground either nearby or at a distance. A new University of Washington study published last month in the journal Climatic Change examined how this process affects people through the lens of public health.The researchers focused on eight villages—four in North and Central America and four in the South Pacific — to learn what happens to people and communities when rising oceans force people with limited resources to relocate.“Managed retreat has disruptive health, sociocultural and economic impacts on the communities that relocate,” said lead author Dr. Andrew L. Dannenberg, an affiliate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) in the School of Public Health and in the College of Built Environments.Co-authors of the study were DEOHS Professor Emeritus Howard Frumkin; DEOHS Associate Professor Jeremy Hess; and DEOHS Professor Kristie Ebi.Learn more about the study here.

"March 6, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Close encounters,"A UW research study looking at interactions between humans and monkeys in Nepal is focusing new attention on how potentially deadly strains of MRSA infection can be transmitted between them.The research highlights the health risks that can arise when humans and animals of all kinds—wild and domestic—come into close contact with each other.“Animals are getting contaminated by living around people,” said Marilyn Roberts, professor in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, who leads the research.“When wild or domestic animals are living in a humanized environment, they are more likely to carry human isolates for diseases.”MRSA— Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus—is known primarily as a hospital- or community-acquired infection in the United States. This bacterial infection can be difficult to treat because it is resistant to first-line antibiotics.Wild animals also harbor and are potential reservoirs for MRSA. A 2018 study in Nepal led by Roberts and published in the FEMS Journal of Microbiology Ecology was the first to isolate a human strain of MRSA in primates as well as domestic livestock.That finding was a surprise for Roberts, also a research scientist at the UW’s Washington National Primate Research Center, who expected to find that wild primates carried animal strains of the bacteria.“More animals carrying human strains of MRSA increases the chances for human infection,” she said.In Nepal, monkeys are often found at temple sites and even in people’s homes eating garbage or food hand-outs.“It’s sort of like ducks along the lakefront here in Seattle. When you walk there, the ducks think they’re going to get fed. Similar to this, the monkeys at these sites equate people with food,” Roberts said.There have been few studies on MRSA infections in Nepal and other low- and middle-income countries, places where people are more likely to have contact with wild animals.Roberts recently won a Fulbright Global Scholar award she will use to expand her primate research in Nepal and Thailand through collaborations with international partners.The research may lead to a better understanding of the dominant MRSA strains among animal populations that could help prevent and control human MRSA infections.Roberts also thinks there’s a more immediate public health message.“We want people to realize that even with your pets, you need to be careful because you can pass diseases back and forth,” Roberts said. “People should never feed human food to animals—domestic or wild—because it increases the likelihood that those animals will carry human diseases.”By educating people about the health consequences of human-animal interactions, “the healthier we will be, and the healthier our pets and environments will be.”Collaborators on the Nepal research also include UW Research Professor Randy Kyes and a research team at Tribhuvan University in Nepal."
"February 21, 2019 | Amanda Pain",A global partnership for child health,"“UW Global Health has had tremendous success conducting research on maternal and child health and infectious diseases in Kenya. Now we have the opportunity to incorporate environmental health and bring these two research communities together.”–CATHERINE KARRA new project led by researchers at the University of Washington and the University of Nairobi will combine environmental health interventions with existing efforts to improve maternal-child health for children living in informal settlements in urban Kenya.The Kenya Healthy Brain Project includes funding to design and pilot a new survey tool with Kenyan stakeholders created specifically for households in Nairobi’s informal settlements.Catherine Karr, a professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences and in Pediatrics, said the tool will collect information on potentially harmful environmental exposures using survey questions and in-person observations.The goal is to build a Kenya-based research program that integrates maternal-child health and environmental health to deliver interventions through existing health systems, she said.“First, we need more data on what current environmental exposures are, then we plan to work with key stakeholders to translate these finding into interventions,” she said.Children living in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk for high exposures to environmental toxicants as well as high rates of HIV infection. The research team published a study in 2018 that showed children with HIV who had increased exposure to air pollution experienced higher levels of cognitive impairment when compared to HIV-infected children with lower exposures.New funding from a 2019 UW Global Innovation Fund grant will enable the international research team to build partnerships that expand its work to study maternal and child environmental health among children exposed to HIV in utero, but not infected.The project will “bring key stakeholders together to build capacity for maternal-child and environmental-health research,” said Sarah Benki-Nugent, clinical assistant professor in the UW Department of Global Health, which is part of the collaboration.Results from the Kenyan household surveys will help the team apply for additional funding to study biological specimens from a UW/University of Nairobi research cohort of more than 200 pregnant women in Kenya. Half of the women are HIV-infected and receiving treatment to prevent transmission to their infants.The team will test the specimens for environmental exposures and look at differences in cognitive and behavioral development in the children as they grow into toddlerhood.To date, most pediatric HIV research has focused on survival rates. But today, more children are living longer with the disease thanks to available treatments, Benki-Nugent said.“Now we have the opportunity to increase environmental health research capacity in Kenya, which could be the key to country-level environmental policy changes,” she said."
"February 14, 2019 | Ashlie Chandler",Air pollution and autism,"Exposure to diesel exhaust during pregnancy or in the early years of development could cause subtle changes in the structure of the cerebral cortex similar to those seen in the brains of autistic patients.That’s according to a new research study from Professor Lucio Costa in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and colleagues that was recently published in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity.An earlier UW study found that diesel exhaust exposure activates pathways consistent with autism-related behaviors.In this study, the team conducted mouse experiments to understand the biochemical and molecular changes that may underlie such changes in the brain’s structure.“These studies provide an animal model that will allow further investigations on the biological plausibility for an association between air pollution and autism spectrum disorder,” Costa said.Learn more about the study.The research team also included DEOHS research scientist Toby Cole and colleagues from Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the UW School of Medicine."

"February 6, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Bilingual app to keep farmworkers safe,"Imagine your job requires using a chemical that could be toxic to you or others if not handled correctly.Now imagine the instructions for safely handling that chemical are written in a language you don’t understand, except for a single sentence: “If you do not understand this label, find someone who can explain it to you in detail.”That’s the reality for farmworkers—many of them native Spanish speakers—who apply pesticides to Washington crops. Pesticide labels are currently only written in English except for that single sentence in Spanish.Now there’s an app for that. University of Washington researchers have developed a new mobile application called PestiSafe (PestiSeguro in Spanish) that delivers detailed pesticide safety information in Spanish and English.The app was created by a team led by Kit Galvin, research scientist in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). Galvin is also an occupational hygienist in the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center (PNASH), a DEOHS research center.Galvin’s team is seeking new funding to continue developing the app after successfully completing beta-testing in 2018. The team is formally launching the app in February during National Pesticide Safety Education Month. The app delivers up-to-date pesticide safety information in Spanish and English via phone or tablet, even when the device is offline.Galvin’s team tested the app with tree fruit farmers in Washington, a majority of whom were native Spanish speakers. About 94 percent of respondents said the translations were clear and understandable, which in turn helped them use pesticides more safely.Galvin and her team developed the app based on a request from Washington agriculture industry stakeholders.“People want to do the right thing,” Galvin said. “Employers want their workers to be healthy, and workers want to follow safety precautions. This app is providing people with a tool to do what they already want to do.”Mishandling pesticides can harm people, crops, communities and the environment. These errors also cost farmers time and money.Between 2010 and 2017, there were 630 cases of occupational pesticide-related illness in Washington agriculture identified by the state Department of Health (DOH). Nearly 80 percent of the cases were related to farmworkers’ inability to access, understand or act on pesticide safety requirements or instructions, according to DOH.The PestiSafe app does not replace the official English-language pesticide label, which is the law, but it can help keep workers safe.Farmworkers who tested the app said the Spanish translation helped them explain safety measures to co-workers and better understand the English pesticide label.Galvin said safety information is updated as new pesticides come to market or label updates are made. The long-term goal is to make the app available nationally for all farm industry workers.In the future, she expects the app will operate on revenue from subscription fees paid by employers.“There is a huge need for this app in the industry, and people will eventually pay for it, but we need funding right now to transition the app from a research tool to a self-sustaining tool,” she said.Short-term funding will help pay for additional development, as well as ensuring accurate translations.Spanish-speaking farmworkers come from different countries where phrasing and accents differ. Finding the right words that are true to the pesticide label but also universally understood is challenging, said Pablo Palmández, PNASH’s agricultural safety and research extensionist.The team is using consensus translation, in which several people translate a document and combine efforts in order to find the most accurate translation, he said.“If we get the money and finish the product the way we have planned, we will be able to have a very good product,” Palmández said. “This product is going to improve the long-term health and safety of farmworkers.”"
"February 5, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Feels like home,"Landstuhl, GermanyA policy-focused career at an international health organizationAt age 10, Brianna Willis knew with absolute conviction that she wanted to be a veterinarian.At age 20—just months before Willis would graduate with a BS in animal science—doubt began to creep in.An internship with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in her junior year opened Willis’s eyes to a new world of career possibilities in international agriculture, crisis management and food security policy.“I geared my whole academic career to achieving this goal that suddenly didn’t feel right,” she said. “I thought: ‘If I go to vet school, this will be the most expensive mistake I could ever make.’”After graduating from Texas A&M University, Willis took a year off before enrolling last fall in the MPH in One Health program offered by the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).She received one of six master's fellowships from the UW School of Public Health, a $20,000 award made to promising scholars that aims to attract students with diverse experiences and backgrounds.As a first-year master’s student, Willis is exploring the health linkages between humans, animals and their shared environments.She is planning for a career with the World Health Organization or other multilateral organization that influences disaster preparedness policy at a global scale.She was attracted to the One Health program in part for the opportunity it offered for mentorship from faculty members with international experience and networks.Her DEOHS faculty advisers include Marguerite Pappaioanou, Peter Rabinowitz and Nicole Errett. Pappaioanou and Rabinowitz are affiliated with the UW Center for One Health Research, which is supported by DEOHS and the Department of Global Health.Willis said she enjoys the feeling of being a pioneer in this relatively new field.As the oldest child in her extended family, she also embraces the opportunity to serve as a role model, “to show them what can happen if you work hard and stay focused.”“I have an opportunity to forge a new path. There aren’t a lot of people of color in this field,” she said. “Animal scientist? Sure. Black animal scientist? There aren’t many, but I’m going to do it.”She recently started her practicum, which involves building a biosafety curriculum for agricultural workers that integrates disaster preparedness with worker health.The One Health program “already feels like home,” she said. Both her classmates and her advisers “want to see me succeed. That sense of community was very important to me.”"
"January 22, 2019 | Amanda Pain",Public health change-maker,"His election to the National Academy of Medicine in 2011.1979“My advice for new faculty is to stay focused early in your career. It is harder today to get grants compared to when I started, so don’t spread yourself too thin.”- DAVID EATON“The discipline of toxicology is more important now than ever, especially with the political environment,” said Eaton, professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).His retirement this spring opens the door for younger faculty members to join DEOHS and continue building the program, he said.“We need to seek knowledge and truth in public health policy that is based on good science. And we need the DEOHS toxicology program to remain strong,” he said.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in premedical sciences from Montana State University, he decided to go to the University of Kansas Medical Center for a doctorate in clinical biochemistry. But he did not enjoy the program and was on the cusp of quitting to join the family business as a jeweler when he discovered the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, paving the way for the career that followed.After receiving his PhD in pharmacology and toxicology, Eaton knew he wanted to stay in academia. When Eaton was offered a position in the UW School of Public Health, he was excited to start the UW’s toxicology program and conduct research with a direct application to solving health problems.“Toxicology allows you to have the best of both worlds,” Eaton said. “You can work on specific molecular processes and apply it to something that makes a difference. The universe of naturally occurring chemicals is vast, and toxicology addresses how these chemicals affect human health.”Eaton also co-founded the Center for Ecogenetics and Environmental Health (CEEH) in 1995 as the field of pharmacogenetics—the study of how genetic factors affect drug responses—was on the rise.CEEH was renamed the Interdisciplinary Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment in 2016.“We thought if genetic factors affect drug responses, it must also be true with chemicals in our environment,” Eaton said. “We set out to understand if genetic factors combined with environmental exposures predisposed or protected people from disease.”One of Eaton’s research projects looked at how a chemical found in broccoli could reduce the harmful effects of aflatoxin (a naturally occurring mold that grows on peanuts and corn), which can cause liver cancer when metabolized.“One of Dave's lasting impacts was to recognize that promoting understanding of toxicology also could be a vehicle for enhancing science education in K-12 classrooms,” said DEOHS Chair Michael Yost.While Eaton was directing CEEH, the community outreach core developed the “tox-in-a-box” resource kit to help K-12 educators demonstrate key concepts in the classroom. Graduate students were then trained as ""tox ambassadors"" who would assist teachers in the classroom with demonstrations.“This was an enormously successful outreach effort,” Yost said, introducing thousands of students across the state and country to the science of toxicology and the broader field of environmental health sciences.Eaton also worked on studies looking at biochemical toxicology, genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens and gene-environment interactions—work that helped launch the Institute for Public Health Genetics at UW. In addition, Eaton held several UW administrative roles, including eight years as associate vice provost for research and five years as dean and vice provost of the Graduate School.Eaton’s official last day is March 16, 2019. He and his wife are building a home near Tucson, AZ, where he will be an affiliate professor at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy.There, he plans to give guest lectures, stay engaged in toxicology research and work with junior faculty to help them mentor students.Interacting with students is what Eaton said he will miss most after retirement. “This university has been wonderful and has given me the opportunity to work with great colleagues,” Eaton said. “I am proud of all that we have achieved together.”"

"January 9, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",Mapping Washington’s environmental health disparities,"It was at the height of California’s worst drought on record that Esther Min saw for herself the power of data to help low-income families.“People’s water bills were skyrocketing, wells were drying up, families were driving miles away to buy bottled water,” said Min, who was working on a water-access study in the Salinas Valley in 2014.“I saw how we could partner with communities to gather data they could use to get the attention of policymakers,” said Min, now a PhD student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Access the mapping tool:  fortress.wa.gov/doh/wtn/WTNIBLDownload our report: deohs.washington.edu/washington-state-envmapNow Min has helped create a new interactive map that shows for the first time how Washington communities rank on environmental health risk factors. The tool was launched this week by DEOHS and our partners.The Washington Environmental Health Disparities Map shows that where you live, your income, race and language ability are among the factors that influence the risk you face from exposure to the harmful health effects of pollution. The tool harnesses the most comprehensive data available to map 19 indicators of community health, combining measures of pollution, proximity to environmental hazards, population health and socioeconomic status into a score used to rank each of Washington’s 1,458 census tracts on their relative environmental health risk.The result is a statewide view of the cumulative environmental health risks each neighborhood faces from pollution that may contribute to inequitable health outcomes and unequal access to healthy neighborhoods.For example, imagine that you live on Capitol Hill in Seattle near the busy intersection of East Denny Way and East Olive Way.The map shows that you live in a community that is ranked 10—among the areas in Washington that are most highly impacted by pollution and the most vulnerable to the resulting health effects.The ranking reflects a variety of factors, from higher rates of poverty and unaffordable housing to more people with greater susceptibility to the health effects of pollution (for example, more people with cardiovascular disease).It also reflects the close proximity of major roadways, Superfund sites, wastewater discharge and facilities using toxic substances.Now imagine that you live 2 miles away near Interlaken Park at the north end of Capitol Hill.This neighborhood has an overall ranking of 1 on the map. The risk you face from environmental hazards drops significantly in this neighborhood, where people generally enjoy higher incomes, better health and living conditions and less overall exposure to pollution.Similar disparities can be found in Spokane, Tacoma, Yakima, Vancouver and other population centers and between urban and rural areas across the state.“The map makes clear that people in communities with lower incomes, less access to education and health care and poorer overall health also shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of environmental pollution,” said DEOHS Chair Michael Yost.The mapping tool was developed through a two-year, cross-sector collaboration among DEOHS; Front and Centered, a statewide environmental justice coalition; the Washington State Department of Health; the Washington State Department of Ecology; and the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.The map also reflects input from nearly 200 people across Washington who helped shape the tool through a series of 11 statewide “listening sessions.”Those sessions included community groups representing immigrants, tribes, farmworkers, communities of color, the elderly and other groups disproportionately impacted by pollution.The tool reflects the commitment by DEOHS and our partners to work toward environmental justice and ensuring equitable access to healthy communities and safe workplaces.“This tool can provide policymakers, community leaders and others with data to inform and shape policies and investments that reduce environmental health impacts on our communities,” said Edmund Seto, DEOHS associate professor who helped develop the tool.“By harnessing data to pinpoint environmental inequality, it’s possible to show precisely where the state’s most highly impacted communities are concentrated and create customized solutions to reduce their risk,” Seto said."
"January 4, 2019 | Jolayne Houtz",The doctors for your life,"“OK, who do we have next?”Dr. Esi Nkyekyer leans forward, listening intently as a medical fellow describes her next patient.The case: A middle-aged man who washed cars for a living but has been unemployed since developing carpal tunnel syndrome on the job. He feels numbness and tingling in both hands even after surgery.The patient also has diabetes but isn’t currently being treated for it. (Could nerve damage from diabetes also contribute to the numbness and tingling he is experiencing, Nkyekyer wonders?)One more thing: The man says he is desperate to get back to work. His primary-care doctor says he can’t return to his previous job. But other medical providers who have evaluated him say he is well enough to resume any kind of work.“So,” Nkyekyer sums up, “it seems to me we need to break this bottleneck.”Established in 1981 as one of the country’s first clinics dedicated to occupational and environmental medicine.Major funding comes from Harborview Medical Center, the state of Washington through the Medical Aid and Accident Fund and other sources.Designated by the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries as a center of excellence for chemically related illnesses.“Bottleneck-breaker” is an apt description for the Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM) Clinic, where Nkyekyer (pronounced en-CHE-cher) is the newly appointed medical director.Here, doctors who specialize in preventing, diagnosing and treating work-related and environmental health issues see more than 300 patients each year who have been injured or become ill from exposure to chemicals or other hazards at work.Their cases can be uncommonly complex, requiring multiple specialists, a highly customized approach to health care and a clinical and administrative team that works together to address patient needs and barriers to recovery.The clinic—located at Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center—is a collaboration among DEOHS in the UW School of Public Health, Harborview, UW Medicine and the UW Division of General Internal Medicine in the Department of Medicine.On a recent day, patients visiting the OEM Clinic included:The clinic also serves as a referral center for workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation who have experienced chemical exposures or injuries on the job.Patients may have multiple health issues—some work-related, some not—that can impact their ability to return to work, said Nkyekyer, a Yale-trained physician who completed an occupational and environmental medicine fellowship at the UW.A care provider’s decision about whether an injury or disease is work-related has important financial, legal, policy and workplace implications that may go beyond a single patient, potentially affecting many other workers.Work injuries and illnesses can affect any part of the body, so the team includes multidisciplinary experts from orthopedists to pulmonologists.Recently, the clinic launched a new practice area exclusively focused on treating people who work with animals.“We’re like the doctors for your life. We’re taking care of your work-related injury or exposure, and . . . we also want to help you get your life back,” Nkyekyer said.Research shows the longer an injured worker is off work, the more likely he or she is to become disabled and unable to work, with a ripple effect on their families and communities.The clinic plays a central role in coordinating across the many agencies and individuals involved in each case, including:Each case generates a mountain of paperwork that needs to be completed under strict deadlines to ensure the worker qualifies for medical and employment benefits and that care is not delayed.“These are people who have hit so many barriers,” said Sherrill Simmons, clinic program coordinator. “I hear a lot of them saying they’re depressed or worried about what happens if they get reinjured.”For Nkyekyer and the rest of the clinic’s specialists, the patient in front of them is often just the beginning of the story.An individual injury or illness could represent a sentinel case, signaling that other workers may be at risk in the same workplace or industry for similar injuries or illnesses.Medical specialists may work with the clinic’s industrial hygienist, experts in the DEOHS Field Research and Consultation Group and others to evaluate health and safety conditions at the patient’s workplace.“We’re intervening at the individual level and at the population level,” Nkyekyer said. “We provide education to each individual patient. But even bigger than that, we’re talking to employers about what they can do to ensure a safer workplace.”The OEM clinic is the primary clinical training site for occupational and environmental medicine residents and fellows, many of whom end up caring for patients across the Pacific Northwest. Specialists also conduct medical screening and surveillance activities for individuals in high-risk occupations.That ability to see both the patient and the bigger population health issues means doctors at the OEM Clinic can catch and address things others may miss.A man in his 40s who suffered a back injury at work recently went to the clinic for an assessment by Dr. June Spector, DEOHS assistant chair and UW director of occupational and environmental medicine.Despite having back surgery, he was still in so much pain he couldn't return to work or participate in job retraining.But Spector also noticed a couple other things: The patient suffered from hearing loss and had an unidentified mass in his groin. Could the mass be a work-related hernia, she wondered?She learned that he hadn’t been able to wear hearing protection at his workplace because part of his job was to listen for incoming phone calls.“He was feeling pretty discouraged,” Spector said. “All of this was affecting his ability to think about his future and to interact with his kids.”In addition to treatment and physical therapy for his back pain, Spector ordered an imaging test for the mass and an audiogram to check his hearing—tests that could indicate whether he is eligible for additional support from workers’ compensation insurance.“The back injury was the only focus for months. If you go in with blinders, you can miss all the other things going on,” Spector said. "
"December 19, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",A matter of scientific integrity,"A group of 15 air pollution experts—including three scientists from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS)—say recent changes made by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have damaged the quality and credibility of the EPA’s scientific review process for federal clean air standards.DEOHS professors Lianne Sheppard, Sverre Vedal and Joel Kaufman are among the group of independent scientists who signed a strongly worded letter to the EPA last week saying the current EPA advisory panel on airborne particle pollution lacks the scientific expertise needed to review federal standards.At the same time, the EPA also overhauled the chartered CASAC panel itself, which now includes seven members, most of whom have little direct experience in air pollution research. Wheeler said in a statement that the new panel members “are highly qualified and have a diverse set of backgrounds.”Sheppard served as a member of the chartered CASAC panel until she was dismissed in October. She felt so strongly about the changes in the panel and the review process that she traveled to Washington, DC, last week to speak in person during a CASAC review of the latest science on air pollution.“The CASAC process is broken, and the sweeping changes that have been made are arbitrary and capricious,” she told the panel. “Today’s deliberations have made it abundantly clear that seven individuals are not sufficiently qualified to conduct the (particulate matter) review that occurred today.”Sheppard called the process “a travesty.”“What they were paying attention to, what they were ignoring, their lack of knowledge about what they were reviewing . . . it was just a lot of ill-informed science,” she said.Until now, advisory panel members were all national and international experts in their discipline areas, used to “drilling down deep” to understand what the evidence shows about the health effects of exposure to air pollution, Sheppard said.Despite being dismissed as panel members, the group has continued to meet this fall as independent scientists to review the scientific evidence. Many submitted individual statements about their findings to the CASAC panel last week.Vedal said the scientists are not expecting their independent reviews to have an immediate effect on the EPA’s process.“Reasoned argument, evidence and facts are no longer the currency of decision-making for this EPA administration,” he said. “Rather, our purpose is to create a record of public comments that could be used in future litigation or other settings where scientific evidence will be valued.”In their letter, the former EPA advisers ask the EPA to reinstate the particulate matter review panel and call on the new chartered CASAC panel to reject the EPA’s accelerated scientific review process.The panel will continue its discussion of clean air standards early next year.Earlier this year, Sheppard sued the EPA over a separate directive issued by former Administrator Scott Pruitt that prohibits scientists who receive EPA funding from serving on its advisory boards.She chose to stay on the panel but was forced to walk away from an EPA-funded research project on air pollution and its connection to heart disease. She is suing as an individual and not on behalf of the UW."

Today, he directs or co-directs three UW centers. His comments have been edited for clarity and length.We were among the first to create cellular and animal models (lab mice) of modified glutathione synthesis. This work is important for understanding which individuals are most susceptible to harmful environmental exposures, as well as for understanding human diseases and our metabolism of drugs.Plants, animals and humans all produce the antioxidant glutathione, which lessens harm from exposure to toxicants and disease conditions associated with oxidative stress. As humans age, glutathione levels drop. But a person’s genetics also affect how efficiently the body replaces the antioxidant as it is expended to protect our cells.We’ve modified a gene in lab mice so that they can no longer efficiently make glutathione. This lets us probe the role glutathione plays in many cellular and physiological processes.We can then relate those processes to common genetic differences in humans that give us variable capacity to make this vital antioxidant—and, therefore, variable levels of vulnerability to suffering adverse health impacts from chemical exposures.Our work can be used to understand who is most vulnerable to toxic chemicals and under what conditions, informing environmental and public health policies that aim to protect susceptible individuals within the broader population.This is especially useful as personalized medicine and precision environmental health policy evolve.We already know low glutathione in animals is associated with negative cardiovascular effects from diesel exhaust. In humans, low glutathione can predispose us to acetaminophen drug overdose and resulting liver damage. And we know glutathione dysregulation is linked with cerebral vascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cystic fibrosis and Type 1 diabetes.Researchers across the country have used the models we (and others) have developed to investigate the importance of this antioxidant in protecting cells, animals and people from various drugs and chemical pollutants and to explore aspects of development and aging, cancer, liver, lung and kidney diseases, inflammation and immunity, psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases.Our work with the National Cancer Institute will investigate the potential carcinogenic effects of e-cigarettes—and not just around nicotine.Important questions relate to the huge diversity of flavoring agents used in these devices. We don’t know a lot about these agents’ toxicity and their ability to initiate and promote precancerous lesions or even cancer itself.Flavoring agents can turn into reactive aldehydes that can change your DNA. This is the Wild West: People are putting in all kinds of flavoring—and it’s largely unregulated. What happens when these flavoring agents get heated up? Is second-hand exposure to exhaled vapors, particles and chemically modified elements from e-cigarettes potentially harmful? Are we genetically predisposed to susceptibility for adverse effects from e-cigarettes?We’re using genetically inbred strains of mice that are predicted to be more (or less) susceptible to these e-cigarette constituents. Hopefully this will let us discover, through genetic mapping, those gene variants associated with susceptibility (or resistance) to e-cigarettes.Yes, I’ve gone from studying the entire environment to cells in a dish. I spent a lot of my childhood in the woods and waters of Northern Michigan, which gave me a sense of wonder about the natural world and inspired a love of science.Today, I hike and camp at Mount Rainier and fly-fish the Yakima River and rivers in Montana. I started college in premed, but found myself also drawn to ecology, evolutionary biology and natural resources. I realized that studying environmental toxicology and genetics was a way to combine my interests in environmental sciences with my interests in medicine and health, letting me contribute to both environmental and public health.I’ve been fortunate to have wonderfully fun colleagues and friends as fellow winemakers for almost 20 years. Each year seems to have its unique qualities of season, climate and timing. The strains of yeast and malolactic bacteria we add all impact our wines’ quality, which gives us a lot to discuss and argue over.Naturally, this also requires frequent sampling as the wine ages."
"December 11, 2018 | Elisabeth Burnor",The more you know,"I recently found leftovers in my fridge that were close to a week old—right on the line between acceptable and sketchy. I performed the tried-and-true smell test, made a judgment and popped them in the microwave. The broccoli tasted fine, the rice was a little dry. All was going well until my mind wandered to a recent lecture on foodborne pathogens in my environmental microbiology course.We had discussed the many opportunities for contamination as food makes the journey from farm to grocery store to kitchen to refrigerator to plate. I began to examine my broccoli more carefully: Had I left it at room temperature for too long? Had I re-heated it long enough? Were there invisible fungal spores in there?The power of hunger (and the reality of a student budget) won out, and I dutifully finished my broccoli. I waited and wondered. I didn’t get sick.At its core, environmental and occupational health is about identifying, preventing and eliminating potential health risks to humans.One unintended consequence? As students in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), we spend many hours learning about, discussing and researching all the ways our everyday environment can harm us.It’s enough to make you a little bit paranoid.During a recent lecture on the risks of microbial contamination in pools and hot tubs, DEOHS Adjunct Lecturer Charles Easterberg told us: “There are a lot of things I didn’t know, back when I used to enjoy life.” The lecture prompted MPH student Kori VanDerGeest to say fervently as she left the classroom: “I will think twice before using a hot tub in the future!”MPH student Jessica Porter told me that she is more hesitant to take antibiotics after learning about the negative effects they can have on your microbiome.Sarah Philo, a first-year PhD student, had the misfortune of participating in a class discussion on food safety and Salmonella one day before Thanksgiving.Her Thanksgiving prep and clean-up the next day looked like a microbiology laboratory protocol, complete with antiseptic wipes to open and close her refrigerator door and a generous layer of disinfectant applied to every kitchen surface after handling the raw turkey.What is the point of all this scary science?I realize that the general public probably feels the same way. News articles are published every day that reveal the risks of sugar, bacon, stress, car exhaust, sleep deprivation, too much sleep, working outdoors, working indoors...the list goes on.As environmental health students, we have the opportunity to improve communication with the public about the risks as well as the potential solutions. As future public health professionals, we can highlight ways to avoid harm or discover new ways to prevent it in the first place. And it’s not just about prevention. The field of environmental and occupational health is increasingly focused on the opportunity to apply what we’re learning to design cities, food supply chains, workplaces and, ultimately, societies that function in a fair and sustainable manner.Individually, many of us are already making better choices as consumers thanks to what we’re learning at the UW.“It’s made me more conscious of water—how much I use and how I can conserve it,” said Philo.Richard Taing, a first-year master’s student, says: “I used to buy airline tickets based on price alone, but now I look at the number of connections, and I’m trying to think about reducing my carbon footprint when flying.”If all of this research and learning means that we can live more sustainably—and perhaps influence others by our example—then I think I can learn to live with a little paranoia.I never particularly enjoyed hot tubs anyway."
"December 6, 2018 | Amanda Pain",A legacy of impact,"1978; served as department chair 1998–2014.Helping to expand the department.“I would urge new faculty to be interested in everything and collaborate broadly while also building your own research identity. Finding a good balance between your personal focus and forming strong collaborations is what a faculty career is all about.”- DAVID KALMANDavid Kalman wasn’t planning to spend his entire career at the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) at the University of Washington.Yet somehow, after joining the faculty in 1978, he never left. Forty years later, the environmental health professor and former department chair will retire this month.Kalman trained as a chemist and earned his doctorate from the UW in 1978. Upon graduating, he was offered a position in DEOHS and eventually served as director of the department's Environmental Health Laboratory, assistant chair, director of the undergraduate program and finally department chair, a role he held for 16 years.“It has been a pleasure working with students, faculty and staff, ” Kalman said. “I am ready to move on, but I hope to not be a stranger after I retire.”Kalman said he always wanted a career in science, and he chose chemistry because it was hands-on. He became interested in environmental health during his undergraduate studies in chemistry, when he took part in a research project looking at salt water infiltration into drinking water in the Los Angeles area.His first DEOHS project—investigating chemical pollutants in sewage treatment plants—hooked him for good.“I stayed at UW because I like the work, and I had an easy time connecting to the research,” Kalman said. “While I found my PhD work in chemistry intellectually interesting in an abstract way, my research at the department was directly applicable to people’s lives.”Kalman said contributing to the department’s growth is his proudest professional achievement.""David led the department's transition in our research to include a broader range of environmental and workplace factors that affect people's health,"" said Michael Yost, DEOHS professor and current department chair.""He encouraged targeted growth through his support for innovative research methods, cross-disciplinary partnerships and a focus on identifying health solutions for populations most at risk from exposures in their communities or jobs.""Understanding chemistry is a critical skill for public health scientists, Kalman said.Kalman has researched chemical hazards in both natural and built environments, such as asbestos, heavy metals in soil, industrial chemicals and atmospheric pollutants. Much of his research has focused on developing biological indicators of human exposure to environmental agents.He worked on several studies with colleagues from the University of California, Berkeley, looking at arsenic exposures in Nevada, Chile, Argentina, India and Bangladesh.Today, that work continues. He is currently assessing samples from Bangladesh as part of ongoing research into the health effects of arsenic exposure during childhood.“Research findings broadly have shown that there is no clear threshold of safe arsenic exposure,” Kalman said. “Even low levels of exposure have led to negative health effects in some populations.”“I think professional subspecialties are giving way to more cross-cutting approaches,” Kalman said. “Adopting a more systems-based approach will transform how we define our research questions and the academic disciplines within public health.”"
"November 29, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",US health threatened by climate change,"US health care systems should extend their commitment to “do no harm” by ensuring that their own operations are powered by renewable energy, according to a new brief on climate change and health in the United States. The brief is co-authored by researchers in the University of Washington Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).The brief highlights the important role of public health in training the next generation and educating the public on the health impacts of climate change.“We need to do much more to prepare and respond and to support the health sector in adapting,” said Dr. Jeremy Hess, a DEOHS associate professor who is senior author of the brief. Hess is also associate professor of emergency medicine and global health at the UW Schools of Medicine and Public Health.Hospitals and health systems exist solely to improve people’s health, yet paradoxically they are a top producer of greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change.“The health sector also needs to take additional leadership on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which harm people’s health, and to continue pressing our government at every level to reduce emissions,” Hess said.Other research partners include Harvard University, the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), University College London and Tsinghua University.Researchers noted that substantially more funding is needed to support local efforts to adapt and enhance resilience.However, Hess says adaptation alone, regardless of funding, won’t be enough.“We’ll adapt to the things that we can, but without aggressive action to reduce emissions, there are likely to be impacts that we won’t be able to adapt to, and we’ll just have to reckon with,” he says. “We can install air conditioning in most homes, but we can’t stop trying to tend crops outside. We can’t move or harden all our critical seaside infrastructure. We can’t stop large population movements resulting from climate disasters. The list of losses that we’ll have trouble absorbing is long and upsetting.”The 2018 report and U.S. brief come just days after a national climate assessment was issued by 13 federal U.S. agencies. It included a chapter on human health, which presented similarly stark warnings of the health impact of climate change for the country.In 2017, there were 16 major natural disasters in the US that together cost more than $313 billion. Among the threats highlighted by the Lancet Countdown's US brief are heat and heat waves, as well as extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Harvey and Maria and the devastating wildfires on the West Coast. Climate change is also elevating the risk of vector-borne illnesses, such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus.Hess said it is urgent that climate change be addressed as a public health issue now.“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, switching to walking and biking when we go places and eating lower on the food chain all improve people’s health,” he said. “When these health benefits are factored in, mitigation more than pays for itself. And it reduces the damaging health effects of long-term climate change.”Hess was among dozens of doctors, academics and policy professionals who authored the global report, which explores 41 unique indicators that measure the health impacts of climate change and assess the world’s response.The research shows that rising temperatures as a result of climate change are already affecting the health of populations around the world.“There is abundant evidence that communities are not prepared for the ongoing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves,” says Kristie Ebi, DEOHS professor and professor of global health at the UW. She is an author of the Lancet Countdown report as well as the human health chapter of the national climate assessment.“Actions are needed right now, matched with investments, such as implementing early-warning systems for heatwaves, including mapping vulnerable populations and providing interventions designed to increase resilience during hot weather,"" she said.Despite a slow response to threat of climate change, experts also cited encouraging signs. Several sectors have seen the start of a low-carbon transition, according to the report. Authors emphasize that the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come."
"November 26, 2018 | Amanda Pain",A new home for population health,"The UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) will consolidate into two campus buildings in summer 2020, including the new University of Washington Population Health building now under construction.The Population Health building is a $230 million project made possible by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It will serve as the home for the UW’s Population Health Initiative and will house part of DEOHS, as well as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the School of Public Health (SPH) and the Department of Global Health.Your browser does not support the video tag.The move offers an opportunity for DEOHS to consolidate our staff and programs and improve our ability to collaborate and interact with other public health colleagues, said DEOHS Professor Chris Simpson, who serves as department liaison for the new facility.“DEOHS is core to the activities of the Population Health Initiative,” Simpson said.“Our department brings expertise in measuring environmental contaminants and stressors, which—together with policy and social science—can identify practical, feasible and effective solutions to population health problems.”About 40 percent of DEOHS will move to the new facility, located near the UW’s west entrance, Simpson said. The other 60 percent will be housed in the Roosevelt building at 4225 Roosevelt Way in the University District, where DEOHS already has offices and space for the department’s specialized wet labs, with plumbing, ventilation and equipment for hands-on scientific research.“For researchers moving out of the Magnuson Health Science Building, the laboratory space in Roosevelt is far superior,” he said. “And for faculty and staff moving into the new building, the layout reinforces interdisciplinary science within the department and across SPH departments.”SPH will bring a majority of its five departments into the new building to create a centralized hub for public health, said Uli Haller, the school’s assistant dean of finance and administration.The new facility, due to open in summer 2020, is designed with collaborative work spaces and fewer single office spaces, he said.The ground floor will be student-focused, with classrooms and areas for student interaction. The facility will also have a central stairway to encourage walking and informal opportunities to connect.Haller said the facility design also maximizes the use of natural light and will feature wellness rooms, gender-neutral bathrooms, changing rooms for people who bike or run to work and kitchens and open eating areas.The Gates Foundation “had a vision when they made this gift,” Haller said. “They thought a new building would maximize our potential to work together and create synergy between groups. Simpson said the new building will likely be home to DEOHS administrative staff, teaching faculty and research centers and departments with ongoing, collaborative projects.Those will likely include the Pacific Northwest Agricultural and Safety Health Center and the Center for One Health Research, both part of DEOHS, as well as other departments in the School of Public Health, such as Biostatistics and Epidemiology.“One of the challenging aspects of planning our move is trying to predict what our department will look like in two years and beyond,” Simpson said. “We have to consider how to leverage the new space in support of the department’s vision that clean air, clean water, safe food, safe workplaces and sustainable communities are fundamental to improving population health.”The new Population Health building is designed to be an idea laboratory and collaboration incubator for the Population Health Initiative.The initiative, launched in 2017, is working to advance human health all over the world and is defined by three pillars: human health, environmental resilience and social and economic equity.

"November 19, 2018 | Lisa Hayward Watts",Clearing the air,"As Central Washington became choked with wildfire smoke last summer, Dr. Mark Larson grew so concerned about air quality measures in Kittitas County that he couldn’t sleep for 10 days.As the health officer for Kittitas County, Larson felt it was his duty to recommend canceling outdoor activities. But as a 20-year community resident, he also knew that the Kittitas Rodeo was right around the corner—a nationally known event that can bring in more than $8 million to the local economy in a single weekend.Canceling the rodeo would have devastating consequences for his community—a threat made explicit by a public official who asked about replacing Larson with a health officer who would OK the event.“I’d become the least popular person in Kittitas County,” Larson said.Smoke in the western parts of North America is getting worse. That was the clear message from Amy Snover, director of the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (CIG) during a recent symposium on communicating about the health risks of wildfire smoke.By the 2080s, the median annual area burned in the Northwest could more than double compared to rates of burn experienced between 1916 and 2006, according to Snover. Wildfires and smoke events are becoming our new normal, but we’re not prepared for the impacts.The symposium was hosted at the UW by the Collaborative on Extreme Event Resilience (CEER) with support from CIG and the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences.Other sponsors included the UW Program on Climate Change, the Interdisciplinary Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment, the Center for Health and the Global Environment and the Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center.Other presenters told related stories—about agricultural communities in the Methow Valley where it’s not safe to be outside when crops are ready for harvest; about tribal children who aren’t able to participate in the harvest of traditional foods; about public schools facing closures when aging buildings can’t stay cool without opening the windows.From a public health perspective, we face big questions:While there are no easy answers, participants agreed that the best answers will come from within impacted communities themselves, shared through forums like the symposium.“We wanted to start a discussion about the ways that the UW’s resources and expertise could be used to help meet the needs of our public health partners as they grapple with this emerging public health challenge,” Busch Isaksen said.Errett sees the event as a first step. “We’ll use the discussions we had at the symposium to springboard new collaborations aimed at tackling wildfire smoke risks to improve the health of Washington communities.” "
"November 14, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Building back better,"Out of the ashes can come opportunity.For the growing number of communities hit hard by wildfires, hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters, the immediate aftermath eventually gives way to a daunting new reality: how to rebuild.New research led by Dr. Nicole Errett, lecturer in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, explores how a natural disaster can serve as a catalyst for a community to build back better, healthier and more resilient.“Rebuilding after a disaster can address not only immediate health impacts, but also the everyday health problems in a community,” Errett said. “If you have health officials at the table during recovery planning, even rebuilding a road can be done with community health and well-being in mind.”Errett, who has a PhD in health and public policy, leads several research projects examining how states and communities can incorporate health into disaster management and planning.She recently assessed 28 state disaster recovery plans in a research study funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). Only about one-third of the state plans mentioned improved health and well-being in their overall goals, she said. Even fewer plans described strategies to address long-term behavioral or health care needs following a disaster.And only a few state plans called for the collection or use of data on the status of pre-disaster community health, making it even more difficult to address systemic health issues post-disaster, she said.States also may lack the knowledge, tools and capacity to address health considerations in their recovery plans, with many government agencies focused primarily on economic and infrastructure recovery.Now, Errett is on a mission to provide public health agencies with the tools to rebuild stronger and healthier communities following a disaster.She will work with local health departments along the Gulf Coast to identify and address challenges faced in disaster recovery planning and implementation through her role as an early career research fellow with the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program.Another strategy she is investigating: How public health authorities can tap “citizen scientists” to help collect health data before and after a disaster. These might include members of faith-based groups, who could report on environmental exposures through tools like air monitoring equipment set up in places of worship or by training congregants to collect water samples.Errett is also exploring whether anonymous health data collected from personal health monitoring applications or devices like FitBit or Strava can be used to track disaster recovery and measure community efforts to rebuild with public health in mind. Funding for this work comes from the UW’s Population Health Initiative.Her work is influenced by roles Errett has held at the local and national levels in emergency preparedness.As part of the Office of Emergency Management for the city of Baltimore, Errett and her team worked directly with low-income and underrepresented communities following disasters. She said the team’s work largley focused on meeting their immediate needs and missed opportunities to help them address pre-existing challenges and health inequities. She also worked as the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response for the US Department of Health and Human Services.In the past year, her research has focused on Santa Rosa, CA, after it was scorched by wildfires and Southeast Texas after Hurricane Harvey to understand what kinds of information, tools and resources local health officials need to help influence decision-making for disaster recovery.“There is a lot of work to be done by researchers to help communities build back better,” Errett said. “Understanding how to design and evaluate tools for disaster recovery planning will have an important impact on improving communities’ health and well-being post-disaster.”"
"November 7, 2018 | Amanda Pain","Real-life experience, without the risk","The UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) will soon incorporate virtual reality (VR) into our worker health and safety training programs—a kind of digital “apprenticeship” that could save real lives on the job.Starting next year, DEOHS will pilot-test VR simulation in some training courses for construction workers and others on how to work safely in confined spaces—think construction pits, tunnels and storage containers. “Using VR in the classroom allows workers to recognize potential hazards before encountering them on the job,” said Nancy Simcox, DEOHS lecturer and director of our Continuing Education Program. The program trains nearly 5,000 safety leaders and workers in the Pacific Northwest each year. It’s the first step toward what Simcox hopes will be a digital transformation in workplace health and safety training, leading to fewer on-the-job injuries and fatalities.This innovative approach to worker training began as a student-led capstone project in the Virtual Technology and Design Program at the University of Idaho (UI).With grant funding from DEOHS through the Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety’s Education and Research Center, UI graduate student Serendel MacPherson and program team member Elyse Vaartstra tested the VR simulation and will pilot it in the classroom in January 2019.Eventually, Simcox wants to see the approach used in all confined spaces courses offered by DEOHS to workers throughout the Pacific Northwest.“We chose to develop the confined spaces VR simulation because it touches so many different industries, such as construction, mining and oil and gas,” said Brian Cleveley, UI senior instructor in the Virtual Technology and Design Program and faculty mentor for this project.  While more research is needed, VR has been shown to improve comprehension and training effectiveness.The next step will be to assess workers’ long-term retention, said Simcox, who has previously used VR simulations to train health professionals on how to deal with infectious diseases, such as the Ebola virus.Cleveley said more companies are starting to value and incorporate VR into training and the workplace. While VR used to appeal only to video gamers, now it is familiar across age groups.“This new generation of students coming into the classroom is already familiar with VR, and it is a great tool for cognitive learning and decision-making,” Simcox said.With VR becoming more affordable and available, Simcox said the technology shows great potential for worker training on a variety of topics, from emergency medical training to preventing on-the-job hazards like falls, electrocution or workers being struck by or caught in work equipment.Both Simcox and Cleveley say they hope to expand the UW-UI partnership to improve worker health and safety.“The key to reducing injuries is increasing workers’ retention coming out of the classroom,” Cleveley said. “We believe in the Confucian saying: I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand.”Other collaborators on the project include: Adam Gerson, safety compliance officer at the Idaho Occupational Safety and Health Administration; Karin (KD) Hatheway-Dial, UI instructor; Jennifer Lastra, CEO and co-founder of 360 Immersive; and Stephanie Carter, senior industrial hygienist at Veritox."
"October 29, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",Co-piloting a program to launch careers,"[Reprinted with permission from the fall 2018 edition of Northwest Public Health magazine.]Jenna Buchanan is on a mission to improve the culture of safety at Boeing. She seeks to learn lessons not only from accidents but also from close calls.Buchanan is a 2007 graduate of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) in the School of Public Health. She recalls how a reporting system and quick action at Boeing helped to protect an aircraft mechanic from a potentially fatal fall.“He later told me, ‘What you did saved my life,’” said Buchanan, a senior manager of Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) at Boeing’s Everett site. She is responsible for the health and safety of 40,000 employees and contract workers. “I know that the work I’m doing matters.”As a Boeing intern more than a decade ago, Buchanan measured workplace exposure to hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing chemical made famous by Erin Brockovich.An admirer of the legal crusader, Buchanan wanted to ensure that all people have access to safe and healthy places to live, work and play. She secured a full-time position at the company before graduating.Now, a partnership with Boeing is bolstering the department's academic programs and enhancing the company’s pipeline to talented students like Buchanan.The bond was formalized in 2017 with a philanthropic gift and the school’s first “Focal,” a company leader who serves as a conduit between Boeing’s EHS teams and DEOHS. There are 61 other Boeing Focals across the UW.“We are engaging with DEOHS to support students and the department and to provide students with insight on career opportunities at Boeing,” said Susan Colligan, who received her MS in industrial hygiene and safety from the UW in 1986. Today, she is senior manager of enterprise workplace safety at Boeing and the school’s Focal. “Our relationship-building includes internships, financial support for students and research, mentoring and other engagement activities, such as factory tours and panel discussions.”Boeing has contributed $45,000 over the past two years to support student research that aligns with the department’s mission to create healthy, safe and sustainable communities. Some projects address issues relevant to Boeing and its workplace safety, but it is not a requirement.The Boeing student support awards are available to all students in the department and other UW students who work with department faculty. So far, 10 students have received awards of up to $5,000 each.“Our partnership with Boeing has provided a vital bridge of support to students who are entering careers in occupational and environmental health,” said DEOHS Chair Michael Yost. “In addition to helping attract strong students to our program, this partnership has allowed them to finish their studies more quickly and with greater focus on translating the work into professional practice.”Many students who receive Boeing support are seeking careers in the private sector and are in the latter part of their degree studies or in an accelerated degree program, according to Yost. “They’re translating academic training into practical solutions for preventing injuries and illness.”That includes Hyoung-gon ""Frank"" Ryou, originally from Seoul, who is using his award to investigate shocks and vibrations experienced by forklift drivers as they operate the machine and to explore strategies to reduce exposure. Whole-body vibration is a risk factor for low back pain.His research has shown that the amount of vibration depends on the type of operation (e.g., driving, loading/unloading) and road conditions. He plans to test three different tires to see which is best at limiting shock. Results from the study could improve safety conditions for operators and potentially change industry standards.“The work setting is where people spend most of their day,” said Ryou, who is pursuing a PhD in environmental and occupational hygiene and works in the UW Ergonomics Lab, led by DEOHS Professor Peter Johnson. “We can prevent common, avoidable injuries by applying ergonomics in the workplace.”Other recent student award recipients include PhD student Trevor Peckham, who is focused on improving aspects of the employer-employee relationship that influence health, and MPH student Orly Stampfer, who plans to work with the Tulalip Tribe to design a health messaging system that alerts people about community air quality.For Buchanan, her internship at Boeing was a major professional turning point. “I was a known commodity. People at Boeing knew who I was and what I was capable of doing,” she said. Classes she took in exposure science and toxicology gave her a good foundation.Buchanan has since mentored dozens of UW interns. She puts them to work on projects meaningful to their studies and connects them to people and opportunities, such as trainings and site tours. In turn, the students channel their energy and perspective into positive change at the company and beyond."
"October 25, 2018 | Jeff Hodson",Meet our new dean,"We recently invited students to pose questions to Hilary Godwin, who joined the UW School of Public Health (SPH) as our new dean in July. Godwin is also professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences.[Read the full version of this story, originally published in the fall 2018 issue of  SPH Connect.]I came to public health kind of late in life. I was a faculty member at Northwestern, working on the toxicology of lead. I realized that understanding why lead is toxic wouldn’t actually prevent anyone from getting poisoned, so I started working with the Chicago Department of Public Health and local community-based organizations on prevention. That’s when I realized public health was my passion.Having a bit of an outsider’s point of view has certainly given me an advantage in explaining the value of public health to others. It’s so important to explain what we do, why it’s important and how public health differs from medicine.Diversity and inclusion are central to everything we do within public health. We care deeply about the social determinants of health and health equity. I’m happy we’ve taken some concrete steps to create a culture that’s more inclusive and that promotes diversity. We’ve hired a chief diversity officer, are recruiting a director for a new center to study racism and health and are committed to ultimately creating an Institute for Health Equity. We will continue to have conversations across the School about what we can do to create a more inclusive culture.From a scientific perspective, I’m proud to have made a significant impact on our understanding of why lead is poisonous and a more nuanced understanding of why some nanomaterials are toxic and others are not. I’m particularly proud of introducing toxicology concepts to the lexicon of so many young scientists–particularly chemists–who have then gone on to use their skills to design new materials that were safer and better for people and the environment, as opposed to just focusing on which materials have better mechanical or electrical properties. In terms of professional impact, I’m most proud of the students I’ve trained. I’ve been privileged to mentor a broad range of students who care deeply about so many important environmental health and public health problems. When I pivoted from chemistry to public health, I shifted from thinking of students as “apprentices” to how I could facilitate their passions and help them achieve their goals. That was a profound change in my role as a mentor.By far the most rewarding things I’ve done have been around interdisciplinary partnerships. I love learning new things and I try to go into new areas without being too fearful of “not being an expert.” Instead, I try to consider things from the perspective of: “Given my background and knowledge and skills, what can I bring to the table and what can I learn by partnering with other people?”Absolutely. One of our big strengths is a popular undergraduate major (“public health–global health”). It was developed by our faculty to provide students with the interdisciplinary skills they need for an increasingly global and technical world. Also, faculty across the school are working to re-envision our MPH curriculum to ensure that our signature degree provides the same kind of cohort experience and prepares students with the skills they need to be successful.I love the outdoors and that certainly was a big draw in coming to Seattle. I grew up in a family of field biologists so my idea of a relaxing weekend is going out in nature or cooking. I love reading. I took up karate when my son was 12 and we spar together. I’m not very good at it. It’s humbling. But it’s very empowering to not be afraid of being hurt! "
"October 22, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Health and safety in the real world,"Growing up in the Middle East, Hamzah El-Himri experienced firsthand what can happen to communities when health and safety regulations are lacking.“I grew up hearing stories about extremely hazardous work environments, where people I knew died from workplace accidents,” said El-Himri, a 2015 BS graduate of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).El-Himri, now a site safety manager at Amazon, was part of a DEOHS alumni panel this month that met with UW students to share their experiences as young professionals in environmental and workplace health and safety.While El-Himri knew from a young age that he wanted to help improve workplace safety, other panelists said they took a less direct route before discovering their career paths.“One of the reasons I chose environmental health is that you don't have to sit at a desk all day,” said Emily Zamzow, a 2017 MS graduate who is now an industrial hygienist for Boeing. “You are out in the field working with people every day, which makes (environmental and occupational health) a unique major.”The panel, open to current and prospective DEOHS students, was hosted by Hayley Leventhal, DEOHS internship and career services manager, as part of an internship preparation and career exploration course she teaches for undergraduates.Zamzow and El-Himri were joined on the panel by Grace Fisk, health and environmental investigator for the King County Local Hazardous Waste Management Program; and Fanny Silverio Gonzales and Shume Merid, environmental health specialists for the Snohomish Health District.Zamzow and Merid, a 2016 BS graduate, both started as engineering majors and switched because they were drawn to the department’s science-based programs. Gonzales, a 2015 BS graduate, started as a history major, then switched because she saw more job opportunities in environmental and occupational health.“I think something that is really special about environmental health is that you get to interact with a lot of people, and in fact those interactions help you succeed in your job,” said Fisk, who earned her BS in 2013 and her MS in 2015 from DEOHS. El-Himri and Zamzow, both employed in the private sector, described their jobs as more team-oriented.El-Himri said he loves Amazon’s fast-paced environment and working as part of a safety team. When he sees a safety issue developing, he can quickly implement a procedure or plan to counter the problem.“We have a board at my site where people can write any issue they are facing, and our promise is we will provide a solution within 48 hours when possible,” El-Himri said. “Having someone tell you their work experience improved because of something you did is very rewarding.”The other three panelists are employed in the public sector and said they typically work alone. Merid, who inspects septic systems in remote areas, said he spends a lot of his day in the car or conducting inspections.Still, he interacts with homeowners, real estate agents and contractors and enjoys the opportunity to learn something new every day. “Just educating someone on the proper care of a septic system can change their lives,” Merid said. “The people I help are thankful, and that makes the job fulfilling.”All DEOHS undergraduate students complete a 400-hour internship before graduation. Panelists agreed their internship experiences proved essential in helping them decide what kind of career to pursue.Flexibility and a little ingenuity are key when applying for jobs in the private sector, El-Himri said. He said he applied to Amazon four times with no response. When he learned Amazon recruiters were going to be on the UW campus at another school, he tracked them down and approached them directly.“DEOHS equipped me to enter the workplace by providing me with knowledge, technical skills and capabilities,” El-Himri said. “It has also given me a valuable network of professionals that I can reach out to.”"
"October 17, 2018 | Nicole A. Errett and Tania M. Busch Isaksen",Let's talk about wildfire smoke and your health,"[Reprinted with permission from the new 2018 edition of Northwest Public Health magazine.] For the past two summers, the western part of the United States has experienced extraordinary wildfire seasons.Dominated by longer burns, fires in locations not previously thought to be at risk, and significant smoke in dense urban areas, these events were a wake-up call to communities with little or no experience dealing with them.To improve our risk communication efforts and keep everyone healthy and safe from wildfire smoke, we must find more ways to collaborate with and draw from the valuable expertise and perspectives of practitioners, researchers and community members.In August 2018, there were few, if any, places to escape from unhealthy air in the entire state of Washington.In fact, the Puget Sound experienced its worst 24 hours of air quality on record, and central and eastern Washington were blanketed in smoke for several weeks. Last year, fires also resulted in moderate to unhealthy air quality in the first two weeks of August and again in early September in western Washington.At the same time, we also experienced higher-than-average summertime temperatures, presenting a unique challenge for our densely populated urban areas, where air conditioning is largely unavailable.In central and eastern Washington, residents experienced even worse air quality resulting from local wildfire events as well as those occurring in British Columbia and neighboring states.There is a growing body of research contributing to our understanding of the health impacts from wildfire smoke. Associations between wildfire smoke exposure and respiratory health outcomes, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have been consistently demonstrated in the literature.Yet there remains uncertainty. For example, consequences of long-term exposure and relationships between exposure and health endpoints, such as cardiovascular disease and mental health issues, are less well understood, and specific at-risk populations are not well defined.Since most wildfire smoke-related health outcome studies look at impacts related to hospitalizations and mortality, the complete picture of wildfire smoke’s public health burden is elusive. The use of the most severe health outcome data limits researchers’ ability to detect statistically significant differences in health impacts of smoke exposure.Using data from rural communities that lack population density, where wildfire smoke exposure is the worst, adds to these statistical challenges. And as wildfires engulf homes, businesses and chemically treated lands, what we know about the composition and health hazards of smoke is changing. Local health jurisdictions in rural communities, often strapped for resources on a good day, bear the burden of wildfire smoke health-risk communication.At the same time, staff and their families may be personally impacted by the wildfires. Another complicating factor for health-risk communicators is their reliance on federal and state air monitoring systems that provide air quality information at a regional level. Because these systems often use a single monitor to assess the air quality of a large geographical area, they provide limited information that can be used to understand and communicate local risk.For example, information from these systems usually lacks sufficient resolution to determine if youth sporting events should be moved to a different location where there is better air.Nonetheless, risk communication activities must seek to change behaviors in communities that have dealt with wildfire smoke for generations while reaching hard-to-access populations such as tourists and seasonal workers.Common protective actions, such as staying indoors when smoke is visible or minimizing strenuous outdoor activities, may no longer be sufficient to protect health given prolonged exposures and increasing severity of air contamination.Without access to air conditioning, staying indoors during smoky, hot summer days is just not an option for many Northwest residents. These protective actions may also be in direct conflict with the economic interests of rural communities that rely on seasonal outdoor workers and outdoor recreation to sustain them year-round.Yet the efficacy of emerging interventions, such as clean air shelters and distribution of N-95 masks to untrained community members, remains largely unknown.Collaborating to improve resilience to wildfire smokeThe University of Washington’s ColLABorative on Extreme Event Resilience (CEER) is working with communities in the Northwest to improve their preparedness for wildfire smoke.This summer, CEER students worked with the Methow Valley Clean Air Project and local health jurisdictions to assess the wildfire smoke health information needs of organizations serving at-risk populations.CEER also planned an October 2018 Wildfire Smoke Stakeholder Synthesis Symposium to bring together public health practitioners to share ongoing practice-based needs, as well as identify opportunities to collaboratively address wildfire smoke, health and risk communication challenges.As our climate continues to change and our communities at the wildland interface grow, we can expect that wildfires and the smoke that they produce will become an increasingly important public health hazard in the Pacific Northwest.By working together, academics, practitioners and communities will be ready to tackle wildfire smoke and other challenges that climate change throws our way."

"October 10, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",Go play outside,"Researchers from the University of Washington School of Public Health watched 225 Seattle residents during their visits to public parks—through GPS devices, activity trackers and travel diaries—and found that they were active for longer at parks that had a greater variety of recreational facilities.The study, published online Sept. 19 in the Journal of Urban Health, suggests that adding facilities to existing parks could be a cost-effective way to increase bouts of physical activity that occur there.“In parks that were otherwise similar, people were active for about 7 percent longer for every additional different type of facility,” said Orion Stewart, who led the study as a doctoral student in the UW Department of Epidemiology.“This translates into about 1 minute and 20 seconds more of physical activity per park visit. It doesn’t sound like much, but if you multiply that by the hundreds of people that might be active in a park in a day, then it really starts to add up.”Study co-authors include DEOHS Associate Professor Edmund Seto, as well as Anne Vernez Moudon, Alyson Littman and Brian Saelens.The study is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Travel Assessment and Community project, a longitudinal study of travel and activity related to the implementation of a public transit light rail system in King County, Washington.Eligible, randomly selected adults were recruited. Participants were asked to carry a GPS device, wear accelerometers to measure physical activity and complete travel diaries of parks visited as well as time of arrival and departure. Data on park location were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive mappable database. Park facility and amenity data were then included for each park record based on park management inventories.Researchers found that each additional and different park facility, such as an exercise equipment site, was associated with a 6.8 and 8.7 percent longer bout of physical activity and session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, respectively. Bouts were defined as engaging in a certain amount of physical activity for at least 5 minutes and included lighter-intensity workouts such as slow walking.Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis and some cancers. Yet more than 90 percent of adults in the United States do not meet the recommended 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week.“This suggests that installing additional recreational facilities at existing parks could be a good way to increase population-wide levels of physical activity, which has tons of health benefits,” Stewart said.Installing additional park facilities could be particularly effective for increasing physical activity levels among those with limited resources who can’t afford the cost of a gym membership.“Compared to the cost of acquiring new land and building new parks, adding a basketball court or walking path to an existing park could be an inexpensive way to encourage people to be active for a bit longer,” Stewart said."

"September 24, 2018 | Amanda Pain",A gift for the future,"We live in an environment that Bruce Fowler calls “chemical-rich.”Our exposure to chemicals found in air pollution, pesticides, lead and other sources begins before we are born and continues throughout our lives. Nearly 1 in 4 global deaths are the result of living or working in an unhealthy environment, according to World Health Organization estimates.Yet the specific health effects of our exposure to all those chemicals remain largely unknown.Fowler, a UW alumnus and expert on the toxicology of metals, saw an opportunity to contribute toward a better understanding of these emerging environmental hazards through a generous gift to the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) in the School of Public Health.Fowler recently pledged $500,000 to establish an endowed professorship in toxicology to help address a pressing need for well-trained toxicologists to investigate those exposures and their health effects.“I am proud of the academic status the UW has achieved, and I have been particularly impressed with the development of the DEOHS toxicology program,” Fowler said. “I hope that by providing endowment support, DEOHS will continue to attract expert faculty.”DEOHS Chair and Professor Michael Yost said Fowler’s gift supports the department’s mission to improve population health, with a special focus on those most at risk for adverse health outcomes.""This endowed professorship supports the very heart of our department's vision to create sustainable communities where every person has a safe place to work and a healthy neighborhood to call home,"" Yost said.""We are grateful for this gift, which will expand our research and teaching capacity in emerging environmental hazards.""Fowler graduated from the UW in 1968 with a degree in marine fisheries biology, earned his PhD in pathology and went on to a career that included jobs in academia, government service and private consulting.He hopes the new faculty position will complement and expand on his own long-standing research in the application of molecular biomarkers for understanding chemical-induced cell injury and human risk assessment.“There is work to be done in understanding public health risks from exposures to technology materials, such as microelectronic semiconductors and nano-materials,” Fowler said. “This is a particular problem with regard to the practice of electronic waste recycling in developing countries that often lack the public health infrastructure to protect communities.”Fowler said his gift, made as part of his estate planning, reflects his deep commitment to the School of Public Health and a strong belief in the UW mission.“Ultimately, it is my hope that the research stemming from this professorship will lead to improved societal decision-making regarding protection of populations at risk from chemical toxicity,” Fowler said.Fowler previously established an endowed fund of $25,000 to support DEOHS undergraduate students. This new gift creating the Bruce A. Fowler Endowed Professorship in Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences is part of the UW’s Be Boundless campaign to raise $5 million by 2020."
"September 20, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",Nothing about us without us,"There is a hidden cost to the fresh fruits and vegetables you buy at your local market.The estimated 2.5 million US farmworkers who harvest that produce are among America’s most vulnerable workers. They face environmental hazards on the job and in their housing and limited access to health care. Too often, they live on the margins of society without a voice to shape decision-making and policies that could improve their lives.Our new video, “Nothing About Us Without Us,” explores an unusual partnership between Washington farmworkers and University of Washington researchers that puts farmworkers at the center of the conversation about how to improve their health and well-being.The UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) is collaborating with farmworkers and other UW researchers to evaluate the health and living conditions of farmworkers in Whatcom and Skagit counties through surveys and in-depth home assessments.“What makes this study unique is that the community is really leading the way,” said Vanessa Galaviz, DEOHS lecturer and lead investigator. The project is a collaboration between the UW School of Public Health, School of Medicine and School of Social Work, with funding support from the UW Population Health Initiative.“We are using a community-driven approach to really get at solutions . . . for people who don’t typically have a voice,” Galaviz said. “You really need those who are most impacted to be at the decision-making table if you want to have culturally appropriate solutions that are sustainable and effective.”Co-investigators on the project are Dr. June Spector, associate professor in the UW Department of Medicine and School of Public Health, and Gino Aisenberg, associate professor in the UW School of Social Work."
"September 5, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",Preventing unsafe opioid prescribing,"A research team at the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) will receive a $5 million funding award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to study strategies to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing in workers’ compensation programs in two states.Dr. Gary Franklin, DEOHS research professor, leads the team.Franklin’s team will compare the effectiveness of two state opioid prescription review programs already in use in Washington and Ohio. Washington uses a prior authorization model, while Ohio uses a retrospective review of opioid prescriptions.Prior authorization requires physicians to get approval from health insurance companies before prescribing medicine, while a retrospective review happens on a case-by-case basis after treatment.The team will focus on opioid prescribing for common musculoskeletal conditions, such as low back and neck pain. Researchers will also examine each program’s patient-centered outcomes, including pain, quality of life and return to work, as well as the presence of opioid use disorder and work disability.Both approaches have proven effective in decreasing unsafe opioid prescribing. However, more research is needed to understand the impact on patients’ health and well-being.Researchers say their findings could influence how other states approach the issue of opioid prescription practices.“One of the key strategic directions to reverse the opioid epidemic is to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing and the transition to ineffective chronic opioid use in common, acute pain conditions,” said Franklin, who is also medical director of the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries.""This population-based project in Washington and Ohio will teach us a great deal about how best to accomplish this goal.”Both Washington and Ohio have regulatory authority over health care delivery to all injured workers. They are also the two largest states with an exclusive State Fund, which means private workers’ compensation insurance companies do not operate in these states.What’s more, both have initiated distinct opioid review programs consistent with prescribing guidelines.This study is among 16 projects recently approved for PCORI funding totaling $85 million to improve care and outcomes for conditions that impose high burdens on patients, caregivers and the health care system.It is also the latest study in PCORI’s portfolio of patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness studies on substance use disorders and pain management.“This project was selected for PCORI funding for its potential to fill an important gap in our understanding of unsafe opioid prescribing and to give people living with pain useful information to help them weigh the effectiveness and safety of their care options,” said PCORI Executive Director Joe Selby.The award is approved pending completion of a business and programmatic review by PCORI staff and issuance of a formal award contract.PCORI is an independent, nonprofit organization authorized by Congress in 2010 that funds research to provide patients, their caregivers and clinicians with the evidence-based information needed to make better-informed health care decisions.Read more about the PCORI-funded study."
"August 30, 2018 | Lisa Hayward Watts",A splash of color in a smoke-choked summer,"The Pacific Northwest’s “new normal” is starting to feel like old normal in Washington’s Methow Valley.This is the fifth summer in a row that wildfire season has hit the Methow Valley especially hard, causing hazardous smoke conditions that persist for weeks and leaving residents feeling trapped and isolated.Cooped up inside, valley residents can get a little stir-crazy as they watch summer drift by in a haze. The alternative—wearing a mask to go outside—only adds to the sense of apocalypse.So Kelly Edwards with the University of Washington’s Interdisciplinary Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment (EDGE) decided to try a new strategy this summer to help community members manage their health while also bringing people together for a little fun.A resident of the Methow Valley herself, Edwards is an adjunct professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and EDGE’s director of community engagement.She also works with the Methow Valley Clean Air Project, a local effort to expand a grassroots network of sensors providing local, up-to-the-minute air quality data.She partnered with two community members, Anthony Twig Wheeler, a leader in somatic therapy, and clinical herbalist Robin Baire, who specializes in teas and tinctures to combat the inflammatory response triggered by smoke exposure. The three worked with Amanda Durkin, a DEOHS undergraduate summer research intern, to set up a booth at the Twisp Farmers Market last week.The group plans a similar engagement event on Saturday as part of a “stress-less” workshop and community dance party with local radio station KTRT on the Twispworks campus from 5 pm to 8 pm.At the farmers market, visitors shared how the smoke is affecting them and tried samples of therapeutic tea. Edwards and Durkin passed out air masks provided by EDGE, encouraging people to color on them with non-toxic markers.“We wanted to give people the right kind of masks,” says Edwards, “but we also wanted them to make them their own. Adding color made them more fun to wear and also kept people from looking sick.”The N95 masks are capable of filtering out tiny particulate matter that poses a health risk. Unlike many masks provided by public health agencies, these masks have an air-exchange pocket at the nose to make exhalation easier and keep internal temperatures cooler.Along with the masks, Kelly distributed a handout designed for schoolchildren with simple messages about what’s in wildfire smoke and how to take care of yourself until it passes.One of the biggest insights from the activity was recognizing the benefit of framing simple, helpful information in a positive way, Edwards says.One suggestion reads: Remind yourself that you’re OK, and the smoke will go away again.“This is what I really needed to hear today,” one older community member told Edwards."
"August 29, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Protecting the pot workforce,"What’s the fastest-growing job category in America?You might guess tech or health care. But you’d be wrong.The cannabis industry is at the top, with jobs growing 445 percent in 2017, according to data from ZipRecruiter.com.In Washington state alone, the cannabis industry had created an estimated 11,000 jobs by 2016, four years after the state became one of the first to legalize recreational use of marijuana in 2012.This ""green rush"" is generating billions of dollars in annual sales and tax revenues along with a new set of concerns about on-the-job health and safety issues faced by cannabis workers.“There are a lot of cannabis workers unprotected,” said Professor Christopher Simpson of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). “Studying their exposures is our duty at DEOHS as we are mandated by the state to protect workers.”Even as more states vote to legalize marijuana, it remains illegal at the federal level. That means the industry is mostly unregulated by agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.It also means there is a shortage of funding to study cannabis workplace exposures and their health impact.Occupational health concerns among cannabis workers include potentially hazardous exposures to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mold, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and ergonomic injuries.“In the absence of federal leadership, it’s falling to the states to protect cannabis workers,” said Simpson, who began investigating workplace issues in the cannabis industry in 2016. “As more states legalize marijuana, we need to work together, learn from each other and share education and training materials.”In 2015, DEOHS master’s student Max Chmielinski collected preliminary data on exposure to UV light generated by grow lamps in two indoor cannabis grow operations (CGOs).Chmielinski’s initial study found potentially harmful UV exposure, which can cause skin cancer, premature aging, immune system suppression and eye damage.In 2016, Simpson and Chmielinski joined forces with other DEOHS colleagues and the nonprofit Cannabis Alliance to follow up. By attaching sensors to workers during their eight-hour shifts, Simpson’s team was able to measure their UV exposures.This larger study evaluated a combination of five indoor, outdoor and greenhouse grow operations, supported by funding from the Safety and Health Investment Projects program of the state Department of Labor & Industries.“It was important to expand the study to all CGO workplaces,” Simpson said. “Only looking at indoor workers gives the false impression that UV exposure outdoors is not hazardous, when in fact, outdoor workers had the highest exposures.”The study found that indoor cannabis workers did not exceed the state limits for UV exposure, while outdoor cannabis workers were subjected to harmful UV exposure, similar to other outdoor professions.Simpson’s team also tested UV bulbs sold to grow operations to compare UV emission levels.Two types of bulbs sold to indoor grow operations (metal halide and germicidal bulbs) had significant potential to exceed the state’s recommended UV exposure limits, with germicidal bulbs exceeding the limits by 300 percent. Simpson said germicidal bulbs are most often used to sterilize surgical equipment in hospitals, where the UV hazards are well understood and well controlled. In the cannabis industry, germicidal bulbs are marketed to cannabis farmers as a way to control powdery mildew on the crop. Simpson said some cannabis farmers purchase higher UV-emission bulbs because they believe these bulbs increase THC, one of the active ingredients in cannabis. Simpson’s study found outdoor cannabis workers overall were more aware of the harmful effects of UV exposure compared to indoor workers.Simpson said many of the outdoor workers wore protective clothing, and employers set up shaded areas for rest and hydration breaks. While some indoor grow operations required workers to wear sunglasses, protections for indoor workers were not consistent.To raise awareness, Simpson’s team created free fact sheets, available in both English and Spanish. The factsheets describe protective measures that employers as well as their indoor and outdoor cannabis workers can take. To date, more than 100 factsheets have been downloaded by organizations in Washington, Oregon and Colorado.The research team’s initial interviews with cannabis workers also uncovered another concern: Workers were worried about their respiratory health, reporting symptoms such as shortness of breath; nasal irritation and bleeding; and skin rashes. A new study will begin this fall with pilot funding from our Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center to collect respiratory health information from workers.“We will look at the relationship between those health symptoms and specific work activities to provide workers with guidance,” Simpson said."
"August 22, 2018 | Lisa Hayward Watts",Getting their hands on science,"Sure, you can lecture teenagers about the dangers of sun exposure. You can tell them that skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.But if you really want the message to hit home, let them discover it for themselves.That’s the premise behind a pioneering environmental-health education program developed by the UW Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics & Environment (EDGE) and a group of Washington high school teachers. EDGE is part of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).The ATHENA program—it stands for the Academy for Teaching about Health and Environment Associations—has changed how health and science are taught across the state since it launched under a different name more than 20 years ago.“We are reaching students in non-science classes and getting them to think about the intricate connections between human health, the health of the environment and the choices we make as individuals and society,” said Jon Sharpe, DEOHS instruction support specialist who helped start the program.Teachers say the emphasis on hands-on science and topics relevant to today’s teens gets students excited about health careers and changes how they think about their choices as consumers.EDGE staff work with high school teachers across Washington to develop classroom kits that teach students about the nutritional differences between natural and artificial sweeteners, the health effects of vaping and other environmental health topics.“Kids like to get their hands on something tactile,” said Marilyn Hair, former community outreach specialist with EDGE who worked with teachers to develop the kits.In the sun exposure experiment, high school students place colorless beads, made of special material that reacts to ultraviolet light, inside a clear plastic box and smear lotion or sunscreen on the clear lid. Other beads are placed in a box with nothing applied to the lid.Then students make predictions: What will happen to the beads when the boxes are exposed to sunlight?The approach itself is backed by science: A recent study from the University of Chicago found that students who physically experience scientific concepts understand them more deeply and do better on tests.The kits are now part of the health curriculum and family and consumer sciences classes in 33 school districts across Washington.“The ATHENA curriculum hits on a lot of cylinders,” explained Lindzee Alvarez, a health teacher at Interlake High School in Bellevue and one of ATHENA’s first participants. “Students bring home resonant concepts to their families about relevant topics and can link to things they are learning about in other classes.”Lessons and activities developed for the ATHENA program are now part of the Bellevue School District health curriculum taught across all of the district’s high schools, thanks to efforts by Alvarez and others to promote the materials.Alvarez and other ATHENA participants convened at the UW last month to document the program’s impact, revisit program goals and discuss ways to measure its future effectiveness.While the original idea was to expose middle- and high-school science teachers to the expertise of UW science researchers, ATHENA now also supports teachers developing and piloting new environmental health-focused lessons and activities, Sharpe said.“When we first started doing outreach to schools, there was a sense that we really needed to get students to do lab-based experiments so we could nurture future environmental health scientists,” Sharpe said.Today, “there’s a new emphasis on really big, interdisciplinary problems like climate change, the built environment and health disparities—problems that will require all sorts of expertise to tackle in the coming years.”"
"August 21, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",Who is hurt the most by climate change?,"Climate change in Washington state affects us all—but not all of us in the same way.Your job, your zip code and your race are more likely to determine your level of risk from climate change than the frequency or magnitude of events associated with climate change like heat waves, wildfires and drought.That’s the finding from a recently released report, An unfair share: Exploring the disproportionate risks from climate change facing Washington state communities.The report was co-authored by researchers at the University of Washington Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) as part of a unique partnership with UW researchers and community organizations across the state.A key finding from the report: People of color, indigenous peoples and people with lower incomes tend to face greater risks from climate change.That’s because the risks often have more to do with population characteristics such as race and ethnicity, wealth, educational attainment, occupation, political voice and the strength of community organizations in helping communities bounce back from climate-related events.Those factors also influence where people live and their occupations. Those who live close to coasts or rivers, in cities or in developed areas that abut less-developed natural areas face heightened risks. And people working in agriculture, fisheries or construction—all industries with large, exposed outdoor labor forces—also are among those facing greater risks from climate change.DEOHS researchers Vanessa Galaviz, Edmund Seto and Katie Fellows contributed to the report, which was produced in collaboration with the advocacy coalition Front and Centered, the UW Climate Impacts Group and Urban@UW.Read a two-page summary of the report here or the full report here."

"July 31, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Learning beyond the classroom,"From Washington’s swim beaches to Amazon’s Fulfillment Centers, students from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) are getting an up-close look at their future careers as health and safety professionals this summer.Nearly 40 DEOHS students are working as summer interns across the US. Their workplaces include state government agencies, county health departments, private companies and nonprofit organizations.“Internships get you out of your comfort zone and help you grow professionally,” said Silvia Rus, a junior in Environmental Health who was selected as one of just 35 students nationwide for the National Environmental Public Health Internship Program.“It’s like putting you in the real world while holding your hand at the same time.”Environmental and workplace health is a rapidly growing field, with jobs projected to grow 30 percent in Washington by 2024.And DEOHS students have another advantage: a dedicated internship manager and career counselor. It is rare among UW academic departments to establish and fund a full-time internship and career specialist.“The DEOHS creation of my role is a great investment in students,” said Hayley Leventhal, who took the position two years ago. “I offer support for students as they apply for and complete their internships.”DEOHS students have an impressive track record as interns. Survey responses show 97 percent of employers would hire their student-interns again, according to Leventhal.“Internships are becoming more and more important to employers,” said Leventhal, citing a recent Job Outlook 2018 survey. “Students want to understand how their education translates into the workforce, and employers want to see professional experience on a resume.”Our interns are blogging about their experiences this summer. Here’s a snapshot of four of our student-interns:Corinna OngOng, a senior BS student in Environmental Health, is an industrial hygiene intern at the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). Her job duties include: assisting industrial hygienists and safety specialists on field visits, conducting employee interviews and identifying and evaluating occupational hazards.“A great thing about working for L&I is exposure to the different types of industries,” Ong said. “I am learning how to communicate with people at all levels, from managers to employees.”Logan DearbornDearborn, a sophomore BS student in Environmental Health, is a swim beach intern for the Clark County Public Health Department.Dearborn samples the three county beaches for E. coli and conducts investigations for other waterborne illnesses. He is also creating a recreational waterborne illness toolkit to provide guidance during an outbreak.“One of my favorite things about this internship is the mix of office and field work,” Dearborn said. “My internship is pretty autonomous, giving me the opportunity to sample and start investigations on my own.”“I think everything about this internship experience is good practice for the real world,” Dearborn said. “It is valuable to see what environmental health looks like outside of the classroom.”Silvia RusFor her internship, Rus was placed at St. Mary’s County Public Health Department in Maryland, where she is researching levels of arsenic in well water. Her primary job is mapping wells, cross-referencing well elevation and depth with arsenic levels.“I grew up in Romania and drank from well water, so I am personally invested in this topic,” Rus said. “I rewrote a letter for well homeowners providing arsenic public health information to make the letter less dry and more personable.”Deanna LyLy, an undergraduate student in Environmental Health, is working as an environmental health and safety intern at Amazon’s Fulfillment Center.She spends her days in a fast-paced warehouse environment where she works with the company safety team to complete daily audits, job safety assessments and incident reports. Ly wrote in a recent blog post that she has nurtured professional relationships during her internship as well as advancing her understanding of the field of environmental health.Leventhal teaches an “internship bootcamp,” a required course undergraduates take prior to starting their internships. It’s designed to help students find, apply for and complete an internship.Students learn to write resumes and cover letters, prepare for job interviews and learn about networking and professionalism.“Hayley is always saying that internships are a ten-week-long interview,” Ong said. “I took this advice to heart and show up every day to showcase my skills.”The number of DEOHS student interns has doubled in the past two years, Leventhal said. To track and support this growing student population, she uses an “intrusive advising” model that proactively reaches out to students.“My goal is for all the students I work with to have the skills and confidence to manage their careers once they graduate,” Leventhal said."
"July 31, 2018 | Amanda Pain",A champion for worker safety,"Stanley Freeman joined the University of Washington in 1977 for what was supposed to be a one-year stint to launch an industrial safety program. That short-term job turned into a 20-year career as he discovered his passion for teaching.Freeman, senior lecturer emeritus in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), died April 5 shortly after his 90th birthday. His memorial service will be held Thursday, Aug. 2.“He was a remarkable colleague that was highly respected and sought after for his knowledge of industrial safety problems and solutions,” said Lee Monteith, DEOHS senior lecturer emeritus.Freeman, who began his career as a safety engineer for Boeing, was an enthusiastic teacher and offered his students hands-on learning opportunities. His students often conducted surveys and investigations into safety issues in industrial settings for their classwork. Richard Gleason, DEOHS senior lecturer, said the classes he teaches today were started by Freeman, including occupational safety management and technical aspects of occupational safety.“Stan was a great instructor and used his knowledge of working at Boeing to present real-world worker safety issues,” Gleason said.Freeman brought with him an extensive background in industrial safety issues.He worked with the DEOHS Field Research and Consultation Group, where he used his expertise to investigate and assist in the resolution of state and regional worker safety issues. In some instances, he testified for workers in court.“Freeman joining our department helped to establish our faculty and students as a resource for local industries and labor groups to seek assistance in solving their safety problems,” Monteith said.Freeman was preceded in death by his wife, Helen.

"July 26, 2018 | Lisa Hayward Watts",Kidney-on-a-chip goes to space,"A cargo spacecraft bound for the International Space Station this winter will carry a breakthrough technology developed at the University of Washington that could help scientists back on Earth transform care for kidney patients.The device is called kidney-on-a-chip. While that may sound like some kind of British hors d’oeuvre, it is actually a device no bigger than your credit card that replicates a working human kidney, allowing researchers to test the effects of drugs in a natural model.Kidney-on-a-chip was developed as part of a collaborative effort between the UW School of Pharmacy, UW Medicine, Northwest Kidney Centers and other partners with support from the Center for Exposures, Diseases, Genomics and Environment (EDGE). The interdisciplinary EDGE center is part of the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Device simulates kidney functionThe genius of kidney-on-a-chip is that it incorporates fluid flow to mimic normal kidney function. A tubule of kidney cells is enclosed inside a plastic case through which drugs can be passed in a system that replicates a working kidney.Researchers can apply drugs with a syringe, pushing medications through the system—even multiple medications at once—without the need for gravity.On Feb. 1, 2019, kidney-on-a-chip will blast off on a cosmic voyage to the space station with funding from the National Institutes of Health and NASA.  Studying the effects of weightlessnessWhy send kidney-on-a-chip to space? First, because microgravity speeds up processes related to the development of disease. Problems that take decades to develop on Earth could appear within weeks or months in space.Second, studying kidney-on-a-chip in space can shed light on medical complications associated with weightlessness.The experiment will allow scientists to probe the long-term effects of a lower-gravity environment on human organs. For example, bone loss plagues astronauts. Kidneys make the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy, so it’s important to understand how that process occurs in a weightless environment. Comparing drug toxicity The device was developed by a team co-led by EDGE members Edward Kelly and Jonathan Himmelfarb with their colleague Catherine Yeung. Kelly and Himmelfarb are already using kidney-on-a-chip to compare the toxicity of different products at different doses.Normally, drugs are cleared from your body through urine produced by your kidneys. That makes kidneys particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of certain medications. Once kidneys start to fail, they limit your ability to process drugs and complicate treatment for a range of diseases, including kidney disease.Until now, researchers testing the effects of a drug on kidneys had to apply the drug to cultured kidney cells on a plate. But that test doesn’t model what happens in the body very well because it doesn’t replicate cellular polarity or the fluid flow that occurs in the body.A more expensive and ethically complicated option is to test on animals. However, animal models don’t always predict human responses.Improving treatment, developing curesKidney-on-a-chip allows researchers to optimize treatment while reducing the need for human and animal testing.In the future, researchers hope to use the chips not only to improve treatment and prevention, but also to develop cures.Two DEOHS professors who help lead the EDGE center—director Terrance Kavanagh and research team lead Elaine Faustman—co-direct a predictive toxicology group that supported the development of kidney-on-a-chip and continues to support its use for environmental health research."

"July 19, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",New concerns about shellfish toxin,"A shellfish toxin that can be fatal to marine life and humans may cause neurological effects in humans even at low levels of exposure over time, according to new research led by the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and the Department of Pharmaceutics.Preliminary results from the study suggest that domoic acid can pose a threat to maternal and fetal health at levels below the official government threshold when chronically consumed.The study is being led by Pharmaceutics graduate student Sara Shum working with DEOHS Professor Thomas Burbacher and Senior Research Scientist Kimberly Grant as well as Professor Nina Isoherranen in the Department of Pharmaceutics.Domoic acid is believed to be the culprit behind a bizarre incident that inspired one of filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock’s most terrifying thrillers.In 1961, hundreds of disoriented birds suddenly attacked a seaside town in California near where Hitchcock had a summer residence. The birds reportedly dove into street lamps, crashed through glass windows and attacked people on the ground. The incident inspired Hitchcock’s movie “The Birds” two years later.Recent research has shown that the birds were likely poisoned by consuming fish contaminated by domoic acid.Humans can contract life-threatening amnesic shellfish poisoning by eating shellfish that have consumed a microscopic, naturally occurring algae that produces domoic acid under certain conditions.Washington state authorities regularly test shellfish for this biotoxin and close shellfish harvesting when levels are greater than 20 ppm.The UW study suggests that chronic consumption of lower levels of domoic acid can be associated with subtle signs of neurological effects in pregnant women and fetuses, such as increased tremor frequency and delays in cognitive development of prenatally exposed infants."

"July 10, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Supporting tomorrow’s environmental health leaders,"Dr. Russ Castner is helping to improve human health—one graduate student at a time.The retired Shoreline dentist never got the chance to use the environmental health degree he earned as one of the first graduates of the UW School of Public Health.Yet his ongoing support for students in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) has fueled national and international research into the connections between our health and the environment.“The earth is in trouble, and we look to these environmental health students to keep us from doing even more damage to the planet,” Castner said.Castner recently completed payments to create the Russell L. Castner Endowed Research Fund supporting the next-generation leaders trained by DEOHS in environmental and occupational health. Since 2015, the fund has supported the research of two graduate students each year investigating health issues that range from Alzheimer’s disease to heat-related illness.“I give to the department because the excellent faculty there invested time in me,” Castner said. “The department is doing important work ... I want to help students training to do the work that I was unable to do.”When Castner entered the UW, the environmental health program was part of the School of Medicine. Halfway through his education, the UW moved the program into the newly created School of Public Health and Community Medicine.Castner was interested in improving air and water quality as well as agricultural practices for safer food production. But when he graduated in 1971, he found limited job opportunities.""When the program first started, it was geared toward government inspection work, and there were no government jobs available when I graduated,” Castner said. “Now the field has exploded into so many areas that touch on so many aspects of health.”Instead, Castner shifted course to enroll in the UW School of Dentistry, leading to a 40-year career as a dentist. But he never forgot his original passion for environmental health.Castner and his wife, Svanhild Swasand, have given nearly $140,000 to the UW through the endowed fund. That includes donations made individually by Swasand, who holds a UW degree in accounting.Together, they support one DEOHS master’s student and one doctoral student each year with awards that pay for research-related supplies and travel. “Funding is tight for students, and this award allows students to complete their research or attend a conference,” said Rachel Shaffer, a PhD student in Environmental Toxicology and 2018 Castner award recipient. “This award is also meaningful to me because of Dr. Castner’s connection to the school.”Shaffer will use the funding to support her research into the links between air pollution and Alzheimer’s disease. The money will allow her to attend a conference with Alzheimer’s experts or pay for additional lab analysis on brain tissue specimens of Alzheimer’s patients.MPH student Kori VanDerGeest will use her 2018 Castner award to make her research accessible to non-English speakers.She will conduct a workshop on nitrate contamination of well water for community stakeholders in Washington’s Yakima Valley that will be simultaneously translated into Spanish. “I am very grateful to Dr. Castner for this award,” VanDerGeest said. “Simultaneous translation will be critical to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to learn and participate.”For Castner, meeting students who share his passion for environmental health gives him hope for the future.“Giving to the school has been a great experience,” Castner said. “I have gotten to meet really exceptional professors and some really smart students with fire in their bellies. They are going places and will make a difference.”"
"July 3, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Caring for the animal caretakers,"Veterinary workers, farm animal handlers, aquaculture workers and others who work closely with animals are at high risk for on-the-job injuries and illnesses.But when those workers need treatment for bites, scratches, kicks, exposure to infectious diseases or other workplace exposures, they currently have nowhere to turn for specialized care.“Animal workers tell me they want a place they can go where health care professionals understand the daily risks they encounter,” said Peter Rabinowitz, associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and director of the UW Center for One Health Research.Rabinowitz and his team are creating that place—the nation’s first clinic devoted specifically to animal workers’ occupational health.The new Healthy Animal Worker Clinic is a partnership between DEOHS and UW Medicine. The clinic is housed at the Harborview Medical Center Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic in Seattle. The clinic began seeing patients in January.Rabinowitz said the goal is to provide patient care for the recognition, management and prevention of occupational injury and disease in animal workers. In addition, the clinic will offer worksite health and safety training, hazard evaluations and education for health care professionals and the public.The clinic was launched with support from the Washington State Legislature through an allocation from the state Medical Aid and Accident funds. The funding supports innovative approaches to prevent and reduce illnesses and injuries in the workplace.There are about 24,000 animal workers in Washington. A needs assessment by Rabinowitz’s team found that animal workers have concerns about exposures to chemicals, infectious diseases, pregnancy-related risks and compassion fatigue related to caring for animals, among other issues.“Sometimes, these workers take better care of the animals than they take care of themselves,” Rabinowitz said. “We want to promote an overall safety culture in the workplace for these workers.”“Animal workers need greater awareness on how to avoid the risks and hazards they face in the workplace,” including from chemical and ergonomic exposures as well as diseases and injuries, said Candace Joy, executive vice president of the Washington State Veterinary Medical Association said.The new Healthy Animal Worker Clinic will educate workers through site visits to animal care workplaces, in-service training and expanded online prevention resources on the Washington Animal Worker Health Initiative website.The clinic will also develop and deliver continuing education courses that focus on animal worker health and are accessible to health care professionals worldwide. Nancy Beaudet, exposure scientist at the UW Occupational and Environmental Medicine program, will lead the site visits. “I hope to encourage animal workers to broaden their understanding of the hazards they encounter and motivate them to implement measures to reduce these hazards and thus minimize adverse health outcomes,” Beaudet said.It’s still rare for practicing physicians to have experience with diagnosing and treating zoonotic diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, said Dr. Debra Cherry, director of the UW Occupational and Environmental Medicine residency program.The new clinic will benefit residents and other health care professionals “because they will gain experience with a unique population of workers,” Cherry said. “Most physicians only have superficial knowledge of the specific work practices and risks animal workers face.”Rabinowitz said the clinic plans to be self-sustaining through fee-based services, Online training resources will be free.“There is a global health implication” to improving animal worker health, Rabinowitz said. “Worldwide, nearly 1 billion people work closely with animals. We are trying to create models that can be applied worldwide to provide animal workers with better occupational health services.”"
"June 29, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",Risky business,"Eating salmon may be good for you, but catching them for a living could be hazardous to your health.Commercial salmon fishermen in Alaska suffer from hearing loss at more than five times the national rate and also face higher rates of other serious health problems, according to a new study led by a researcher in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) and others from the School of Public Health.""Commercial gillnet fishing is difficult and dangerous work,"" said senior author Debra Cherry, a DEOHS adjunct associate professor. ""Gillnetting has unique risks compared to other types of fishing, especially for upper extremity injury. Fishermen have to set out and reel in the long net and pick off each salmon.""The study, published in the Journal of Agromedicine, surveyed and assessed a group of gillnet fishermen along Alaska's Copper River who catch and sell what some call the world's finest salmon. The study was conducted in partnership with Alaska Sea Grant.About 80 percent of fishermen who completed a hearing test had a pattern suggestive of noise-induced hearing loss, compared with the 15 percent norm for Americans. They also had significantly higher rates of upper extremity injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis, and were at increased risk for sleep apnea.Researchers found evidence of upper extremity disorders of the hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder combined in 70 percent of physical exam participants. Rotator cuff tendonitis, in particular, affected 40 percent of participants. The national norm is 8 percent to 14 percent.""The fleet is self-employed. There is no corporate entity that protects them,"" Cherry said. ""We need to be mindful of the risk, provide guidance to these fishermen and advocate for the promotion of the least risky work practices.""The start of salmon fishing season on the famed Copper River in Cordova, Alaska, is met every May with fanfare by people in the Pacific Northwest. The wild salmon is prized for its high fat content and rich flavor.Some 550 fishing vessels are licensed to use drift gillnets to catch salmon. The nets are hung vertically in the water, up to 150 fathoms in length, drifting with the tide and current.Cherry also points out the small size of typical boats used for gillnetting, which often have crews of only one to three people. ""Fishermen are at risk of noise exposure because they're working so close to the boat's engine. It's just right there,"" she said. ""However, many of the fishermen also had loud hobbies, such as hunting and snowmobiling, so we can't say for sure that their hearing loss was tied to their job.""The potentially high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is also concerning, say the authors. Less sleep combined with poor quality sleep may exacerbate fatigue during the fishing season.Researchers surveyed fishermen before and halfway through the 2015 fishing season, which generally lasts four months. Study co-author Torie Baker, a marine advisory agent at Alaska Sea Grant, and members of Cordova District Fishermen United invited 600 fishermen to answer questions about medical and work history, sleep habits, alcohol and tobacco use, mental health, physical fitness and noise exposure.Twenty fishermen underwent a complete physical exam, where their hearing and aerobic fitness were tested. Some were also outfitted with Fitbits to track activity and sleep habits.Nearly 80 percent of the fishermen considered themselves healthy and had evidence of above-average fitness before fishing season began. Compared to the general Alaskan population, study participants reported less tobacco use, more regular doctors' visits for health maintenance and higher rates of health insurance.Seventy percent of fishermen in the study were overweight or obese, which is about average for the population of Alaska, and participants reported less aerobic exercise during the fishing season, likely due to cramped space on fishing vessels.Busy work schedules and excessive fatigue were also reported. Fishing periods usually lasted 24 to 48 hours, with little chance of sleep and unpredictable bursts of heavy activity.Sixty-six fishermen took part in the preseason online survey, and 38 responded to the midseason survey. Most fishermen in the study were white males, at an average age of 49 with 27 years of commercial fishing experience.The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health funded the study through the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center within DEOHS. Lead author Carly Eckert is a doctoral student in the UW Department of Epidemiology."
"June 25, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",Making workplaces safer through science,"Vanessa Vargas showed up for her first day at her new job with her heart pounding so loud it nearly drowned out the sound of construction equipment at the Seattle building site where she had been hired as a carpenter apprentice.Vargas was the youngest person on the work site, the least experienced—and the only woman.“My adrenaline’s going, and I’m just trying to be careful of every move I make so I look like I know what I’m doing,” Vargas recalled. “You don’t want to make any mistakes.”Persistent job stress like that can take a toll on your health and leave an unmistakable signature behind within your own blood. Now researchers in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) are using those biological markers in a first-of-its-kind study that will objectively measure differences in stress biomarkers among both women and men construction workers.The stress study builds on earlier research by a DEOHS research team that found Washington women construction workers were significantly more likely than men to report being injured at work and to feel high levels of stress.“For women construction workers, we know that their gender puts them at greater risk for on-the-job injuries and illnesses,” said DEOHS Professor Noah Seixas, who is overseeing the study.The study is one of several new pilot projects led by DEOHS faculty and funded annually by the Washington State Legislature through allocations from the state Medical Aid and Accident funds. The money acts as seed funding for innovative approaches to prevent and reduce workplace illnesses and injuries.Vargas was among a dozen construction workers who volunteered recently to participate in the stress study at the Renton Carpenters Local 30 Union Hall.UW students and faculty helped the workers complete a questionnaire about their health and sources of stress both on and off the job and took height and weight measurements. A nurse collected a blood sample from each participant. The samples will be analyzed at a UW lab for biomarkers of stress in the workers’ immune, inflammatory and hormone response systems.When the study is complete later this year, researchers will have data from 40 construction workers, including women and men at both the apprentice and more experienced journey levels and across different trades. Partners in the research include the Carpenters Employers Apprenticeship Training Trust, the Sheet Metal Workers Local 66 and the Seattle Area Pipe Trades Apprenticeship.Just 3 percent of the nation’s skilled trades workforce are women—about the same level as in the 1970s. That’s despite relatively high wages and a nationwide shortage of skilled construction labor.Widespread gender discrimination, isolation, sexual harassment and ill-fitting personal protective gear designed for men are among the stressors tradeswomen face in what is one of the most dangerous professions, said Hannah Curtis, DEOHS research coordinator.“We need better data on how stress affects construction workers’ health and their ability to communicate their needs and work safely,” Curtis said. “That will inform programs to improve workplace culture and training and potentially open the door for more women to consider careers in the trades.”Several study participants said they had experienced discrimination on the job but also saw signs of progress.Betty Cormier has worked in construction for three years, doing framing and concrete work. While the job is tough, she believes her co-workers and supervisor take a personal interest in her welfare and safety on the job, she said.Vargas said she also sees things improving. Recently, she noticed what she calls “juvenile pictures” scribbled on the wall of her job site. The next day, she came back to find that the graffiti had been covered with plywood.“I feel like people are pretty respectful of me. You may overhear things that make you uncomfortable sometimes, but I just keep on working,” she said."
"June 20, 2018 | Ashlie Chandler",Promoting healthy aging,"Editor’s note: This is part of an occasional series of Q-and-A interviews with students in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).My thesis is looking at disaster resilience for older adults in King County. I’m planning to interview senior center directors about how their organizations can support older adults’ health and safety during and after a natural disaster. I’ve also been working with my adviser, DEOHS lecturer Nicole Errett, on a project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that looks at how state laws address public health during disaster recovery. For my practicum, I’m working with Lecturer Tania Busch Isaksen and partners at Public Health—Seattle & King County to assess how an innovative risk communication tool (it’s a comic!) can improve older adults’ understanding of the health risks of extreme heat. As people age, their bodies have a harder time adapting and their risk of heat-related illness increases.One of my favorite classes was through the Livable City Year program. I was on a team with forestry graduate students, who were amazing at identifying trees. We spent the quarter working with Tacoma’s urban forester and planner to develop recommendations for the city’s upcoming tree planting project. We focused on how the project could be implemented in partnership with the community to address inequities in access to urban green space.I’ve loved observing and being part of civic life in Seattle; it’s a really interesting time to be in this city and to see how it grapples with challenges like homelessness, gentrification and rapid growth. We have fantastic civic servants who care deeply about making Seattle and King County a healthier, more equitable and more resilient place to live.To find a PhD program where I can continue to explore solutions to the challenge of creating policies, programs and environments that support healthy aging and promote health equity. After that, I see myself working for a government agency or a think tank that’s committed to partnering with communities to promote health and well-being at every age.Public health is a truly collaborative field, and that’s really fulfilling to be a part of. I think public health makes the biggest impact by engaging a diverse group of partners and working at a systems level to promote health and address social inequities.My hometown is Atlanta, and I was excited to live in a new part of the country. I thought the UW’s connections to local, county and state government would offer valuable opportunities for connecting my studies to policy and practice. I also appreciated how many amazing schools and interdisciplinary programs the UW offered, because I wanted to integrate my public health courses and research with other disciplines such as public policy, sociology and environmental science.This spring, I volunteered to help organize an event called Worker’s Memorial Day that honored the 65 workers who lost their lives on the job in Washington state in 2017. I’ve also put a lot of time recently into working with students and staff in my department to make sure next year’s incoming students feel welcome and supported. We’re creating a mentor program and weekly brown-bag lunch to create a space where first-years can learn from each other. In my free time, running has been a great way to explore and get away from my laptop. I also like to bake bread, and my friends tease me for this, but I love making friends with my neighborhood cats.Don’t be afraid to ask tough questions before you decide on a program. Wherever you end up, finding mentors makes all the difference in the world.Ashlie Chandler is a content strategist and writer at the UW School of Public Health."
"June 14, 2018 | Amanda Pain",“Their voices can be quite powerful”,"At the Western Hemisphere’s busiest land border crossing, tens of thousands of vehicles wait each day, engines idling, to cross between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.Researchers know that the 30,000 residents of San Ysidro, on the US side of the crossing, live with spikes in air pollution, higher levels of asthma and other negative effects from those car emissions.But what’s happening just across the border in Tijuana, one of Mexico’s largest cities?“It is all one shared air basin,” said Edmund Seto, associate professor in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Now Seto is working with researchers in Mexico and the US on a new phase of the air quality study that he hopes will encourage binational emissions reduction. “Air pollution can’t be solved on the US side alone,” he noted.Seto and his colleagues launched the new study with a $100,000 grant from the North American Development Bank. Study investigators come from the University of Washington, San Diego State University, Autonomous University of Baja California and Casa Familiar, a local community development nonprofit.They will install six air-quality monitoring sites throughout Tijuana to sample the air and provide real-time data to local residents as well as investigators—an innovative approach that puts information about air pollution into the hands of those most affected by poor air quality.The project builds on an earlier study led by Seto and colleagues that used low-cost monitors to measure air quality in San Ysidro, a low-income community about a 30-minute drive south of downtown San Diego.Air pollution is associated with a range of health risks, from heart and lung diseases to diabetes, obesity and dementia. A 2015 study found that residents in the San Ysidro area have rates of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease about 20 percent higher than the county as a whole.This new phase of research comes at an important juncture for people living near the border.Every day, nearly 70,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians travel northbound through the San Ysidro border crossing. Northbound traffic at this border point is projected to increase 87 percent by 2030.A redevelopment project now under way aims to reduce congestion and idling vehicles that can wait two hours or more to cross the border. It is expected to be completed by summer 2019 and will have 62 inspection booths across 34 lanes.“The hope is these changes have a positive effect on air quality,” Seto said. “High levels of pollutants are detected with so much traffic.”The study’s focus on ensuring local residents are engaged in and actively contribute to the research aims to put decision-making authority in the hands of the community.In Seto’s previous study in San Ysidro, community members suggested monitoring sites, attended community meetings and conferred with investigators and the California Environmental Protection Agency.“Community involvement increases engagement around air quality issues,” Seto said. “It can be difficult for residents to address emission reductions alone, but once they have a dialogue with government agencies, their voices can be quite powerful.”Now, investigators will create a new steering committee with San Ysidro and Tijuana residents and facilitate engagement between Tijuana residents and members of the Secretariat for Environmental Protection, the environmental authority in the Mexican state of Baja California.“Hopefully, this can be the start of something with lasting positive impact on the community,” Seto said.The research team is also seeking additional funding to expand monitoring beyond the San Ysidro-Tijuana area.“We want to leverage our current community engagement model to expand our reach,” Seto said. “Our focus has been on border crossings, but people in other communities have other air quality concerns. And engaging residents means listening to those concerns and addressing them.”"
"June 14, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Honoring an inspirational leader,"A UW climate-change researcher dedicated to her students’ success was selected as the 2018 outstanding faculty mentor by students in the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Lecturer Tania Busch Isaksen was honored this month with the coveted award, which is given annually by members of the Graduate Student Advisory Committee. She is also a clinical assistant professor in the UW Department of Health Services. Busch Isaksen is known for her approachability and dedication to her students’ research and career goals, said Meagan Jackson, who worked closely with Busch Isaksen as a master’s student and nominated her for the award.“Tania is skilled at breaking down complex information so it is easy for people to understand,” Jackson said. “She is passionate about climate change, and she encourages students to make better decisions that will affect change on a local and global scale.”As Jackson’s thesis adviser, Busch Isaksen challenged Jackson to think about how each person’s day-to-day activities affect the environment and how the conditions in which people are born, live and work affect their health decisions.“She advised me both in academics and my professional development,” Jackson said. “She encouraged me to be a hard worker while balancing my personal life.”Busch Isaksen earned her PhD from the UW in Environmental and Occupational Hygiene. She currently serves as the DEOHS undergraduate program coordinator.Her research focuses on health outcomes associated with extreme heat and climate change, as well as occupational health and safety risks in the cannabis industry. She has more than 25 years of environmental public health experience in both practice and academic settings.DEOHS student Annie Doubleday, who is pursuing her MPH, said she reached out to Busch Isaksen early in her program because of their shared interest in climate change research. Busch Isaksen serves as Doubleday’s thesis adviser on a project studying the health effects of wildfire smoke. With her help, Doubleday has also involved stakeholders from the state departments of Health and Ecology in her research.“I really admire her ability to work effectively with people of all disciplines and backgrounds,” Doubleday said. “I have learned a lot from watching her rigorous approach to research and how involving practice partners ensures her work has impact beyond academia.”Both Jackson and Doubleday say Busch Isaksen cares about them as people, not just as students.“She loves working with students,” Doubleday said. “She goes out of her way to make sure students are doing well and making the most of their degree program.”Both undergraduate and graduate students seek Busch Isaksen out, knowing they can stop by her office anytime, Jackson said.“Tania excels at not only answering student questions, but connecting those students with relevant research and practice opportunities that address their questions,” Jackson said."

"June 4, 2018 | Lisa Hayward Watts",Arsenic in the water,"Nothing about Lake Killarney’s idyllic appearance hints at the potential cancer risk lying below the surface.The shallow lake in South King County, Washington, is ringed with homes and the headquarters of the international relief organization World Vision. The lake is favored by waterfowl, rich with aquatic plants and stocked with rainbow trout, largemouth bass and other fish.So it came as a surprise to Dr. James Gawel when he and his undergraduate students from the University of Washington (UW) Tacoma measured high levels of arsenic in water samples from Lake Killarney.“It was pretty amazing to find this little lake that broke the rules about what we thought we knew about lake chemistry,” Gawel said.The lake is located downwind from the former ASARCO smelter in Ruston. Aerial transport of lead and arsenic from the former smelter led to widespread contamination in the area and its eventual designation as one of the first Superfund sites in the nation.“Normally, when oxygen is present, arsenic tends to stick to particles and fall out of the water column,” Gawel explained, and then settle at the bottom in the sediments.Gawel is an associate professor in UW Tacoma’s School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. He studies arsenic in lakes as part of the UW Superfund Research Program housed at UW’s Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences. The program—one of the first university-based Superfund research centers—conducts research on environmental chemicals and remediation practices for hazardous waste sites.Lake Killarney turned out to have levels of arsenic more than six times the minimum level that the Washington Department of Ecology identifies as likely to have harmful effects on sediment-dwelling organisms.Gawel recently co-authored a paper about arsenic in shallow lakes in Science of the Total Environment with Dr. Rebecca Neumann, assistant professor in the UW Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.Even given the area's environmental history and the high levels of arsenic in the sediment, finding it in Lake Killarney’s water column was a surprise.Shallow lakes like Lake Killarney are less likely to show the type of stratification that larger lakes exhibit, Gawel explained. In summer, cold, heavier waters typically occupy lake bottoms in a layer that doesn’t mix with warmer surface waters because of their different densities. This stratification tends to keep arsenic trapped at the bottom of the lake.In contrast, shallow lakes warm up more thoroughly and don’t form separate layers. That leaves more opportunity for arsenic in the sediment to mix into the water.Second, arsenic resembles phosphorus in its chemical structure—enough so that microscopic marine algae can mistakenly take it up instead of the phosphorus they need to grow and reproduce.In oxygen-rich water, these phytoplankton can take up arsenic so quickly that it doesn’t have a chance to bind to particles and settle into the sediment. Instead, arsenic enters the food chain as part of the phytoplankton that feed zooplankton, insects, fish and other organisms.Does arsenic in shallow lakes pose a hazard to human health?Exposure to arsenic is known to increase the risks of cancer. But because arsenic is water-soluble, it can be flushed from the body rather than accumulating in fat, and it diminishes in concentration as it moves up the food chain.One of the biggest concerns is the level of potential arsenic exposure associated with eating warm-water fish species like sunfish, crappies and bottom-dwelling crayfish. These fish are favored by people who visit Lake Killarney and other area lakes to fish for supplemental food for their families.Gawel and Neumann are currently collaborating with Dr. Julian Olden of UW’s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Science to sample arsenic in lake fish and crayfish. Olden will begin gill-netting this summer at Lake Killarney and other area lakes.Ultimately, Gawel said the team wants to better understand the chemical and physical transfer of arsenic from sediments to lake water and characterize how much arsenic may make its way into the fish people catch and eat."
"May 31, 2018 | Amanda Pain",On the front lines of climate change,"Harvard, MassachusettsAssociate Service Fellow, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health“Trade workers have higher (environmental) exposures than the general public because they are working in industries with concentrated chemicals or a longer duration of heat exposure. These workers often have less agency to change their environment.”- MIRIAM CALKINSApril marked a grim global milestone: the 400th consecutive month with recorded global temperatures above the 20th century average.For construction workers and others who spend long hours working outside, global warming is a trend with potentially life-or-death consequences.But how do you measure the health effects of heat exposure on individual workers? That question is at the heart of Miriam Calkin’s work as a doctoral student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).In May, Calkins was selected by UW School of Public Health faculty as the winner of the 2018 Gilbert S. Omenn award, recognizing her contributions to public health, commitment to community engagement and leadership potential.Through her research, Calkins found that as temperatures rise, so do the number of traumatic injuries among construction workers as well as the number of heat-related illnesses and injuries among the general working-age population.Most surprising: Even on days when temperatures were only moderately hot, on-the-job injuries and illnesses increased, including among young, healthy workers who are typically considered more resilient.Calkins was one of the first to document the connection between heat exposure and injuries using data from the state worker’s compensation system, said DEOHS chair Michael Yost.Her work has increased awareness that the risks of working outside in hot temperatures extend to workers in construction as well as agriculture in both Eastern and Western Washington and across all age groups, Yost said.The findings point to the need for additional protection for outdoor laborers, Calkins said.“Even prior to someone’s awareness of being too hot, there is an increased risk of injuries,” Calkins said. “This means that even on a day not considered too hot for working, the industry still needs to be prepared for increased risk for injuries.”Calkins became interested in measuring heat exposure as a master’s student working with DEOHS Lecturer Tania Busch Isaksen.She used emergency response data in King County to show that temperatures above 85.5℉ increased the risk for basic life support calls by 8 percent. When temperatures hit 98℉ or more, calls for advanced life support rose 14 percent across all age groups compared to days with lower temperatures.Calkins decided to continue that research while getting her PhD at DEOHS as well as a graduate certificate in climate sciences. Her conclusion: Construction workers in Washington state are at greater risk for falls, broken bones, concussions and other traumatic injuries as temperatures rise.Researchers often measure individual heat exposure through survey questions that rely on the person’s perception of experiencing symptoms. Being able to measure actual metabolic and environmental data in real time is challenging, Calkins said.Part of Calkins’s research involved measuring individual heat exposure through devices that record the temperature immediately around each worker, rather than using a single device placed at a worksite.While the results were not statistically significant, Calkins said additional research is needed. “We know that the workers are at higher risk, but we don’t have the data right now to provide better recommendations for them.”Now is the time for workers, companies and regulatory authorities to prepare for increasing temperatures, Calkins said.Washington is one of only two states with outdoor heat rules specifically addressing on-the-job heat exposure. Some cities, including Phoenix, have also put specific regulations and safety precautions in place for outdoor workers.Seattle and other cities need to be ready to protect road crews, roofers and other construction workers who will face greater risk with rising temperatures, she said.Calkins will begin a two-year fellowship this summer with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, working on a study to measure heat and particulate matter exposure among wildland firefighters.“I have an appreciation for how difficult it is to actually measure what workers are exposed to in the environment,” Calkins said. “We need more information to understand heat exposure, and I want to refine how exposure is measured and ultimately develop safer work conditions.”"
"May 29, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",The end of TB?,"What if a simple oral swab could help eliminate a disease that kills nearly 2 million people every year?That’s the premise behind an international effort led by researchers in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) that could revolutionize the way tuberculosis (TB) is diagnosed.Using cotton or polyester swabs to collect bacteria samples from the mouths of patients for diagnostic testing could allow health care providers to test more people more quickly at lower cost than existing methods—and get patients into treatment faster.This promising approach just got a sizeable funding boost from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, raising hopes that it could become part of the global strategy to end TB by 2030.Early diagnosis and treatment is key to reducing the spread of TB, which killed 1.7 million people in 2016, including 210,000 children, according to the World Health Organization.“With TB, there’s a week where you think you have a cold,” said DEOHS Professor Gerard Cangelosi, who leads the research study. He is also an adjunct professor of epidemiology and global health in the UW School of Public Health.“Then the second week, you think it’s really awful. And the third week, you realize you’re dying, and you go get diagnosed with TB. During that interval and until you begin treatment, you are highly contagious,” Cangelosi said.The Gates Foundation announced today that Cangelosi’s team was awarded a $100,000 Grand Challenges Explorations grant to support continued development of the oral swab diagnostic method and research into how samples can be collected, stored and transported.So how could the decidedly low-tech swab—a medicine-cabinet staple invented nearly 100 years ago—transform the global fight against TB, the world’s top infectious disease killer?First, let’s talk about sputum.To test for TB now, a health care worker gathers a sample from a suspected TB patient who coughs up thick, mucousy sputum from the lungs. Many health workers say collecting sputum is the worst part of their jobs, Cangelosi said. “It freaks them out.”Workers are at risk for exposure to the disease when patients cough. Collecting samples from children is especially hard because health workers have to make children gag until they produce enough sputum for testing.And the substance is hard to work with—even trained laboratory technicians can have difficulty identifying TB bacteria when looking at sputum samples under a microscope.In 2012, Cangelosi began an unlikely collaboration with Lisa Jones-Engel, a UW anthropologist who approached Cangelosi about a technique she was using in her veterinary research to sample for TB in monkeys.She was using swabs to collect bacteria samples from inside the cheeks of monkeys--a simple, non-invasive technique that allowed her to accurately diagnose TB.Could the same method be used in humans? Much of the TB research community was skeptical.“Nobody believed her, but I believed her,” Cangelosi said. “I was trained as a bacteriologist. You scrape surfaces because all bacteria like to stick to surfaces. That’s where they live.”The human version of the test involves a 10-second swab of the tongue or cheeks—no coughing or sputum required.Samples are then analyzed for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Earlier research showed that researchers using the oral swab method correctly detected TB in most adult participants with the infection.Rachel Wood, a DEOHS research scientist, began working on the project with Cangelosi as a DEOHS graduate student. She remembers Cangelosi initially describing the work as “high risk, high reward.”Since then, she and lab teammates have analyzed nearly 2,000 TB samples collected by research collaborators in South Africa. Wood still gets excited when she finds positive samples. “To have it all coming together, with this being proposed as an alternative diagnostic test, is really amazing,” she said.This is the second round of Gates Foundation funding for the project, which was initially launched with seed money from DEOHS.The next step is critical: showing that “everything you can do with sputum you can do with swabs,” Cangelosi said.That means you have to be able to collect, store, transport and test samples in a way that yields results at least as accurate as the sputum method.“To have it all coming together, with this being proposed as an alternative diagnostic test, is really amazing.”- RESEARCH SCIENTIST RACHEL WOODMany TB researchers are trading their skepticism for cautious optimism that this innovative approach could help reduce the global burden of TB, he said.It’s also an example of the potential impact of increased collaboration between human and veterinary medicine. DEOHS is home to the Center for One Health Research, which investigates the links between human, animal and environmental health.If the oral swab method is validated as a new diagnostic tool, the biggest impact could be in large institutional or community settings where TB can spread quickly from person to person.“If you want to sample an entire prison or school or garment factory, you can’t get sputum samples from such large populations,” Cangelosi said. “But you can do it with oral swabs.”Other UW DEOHS research collaborators include the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative and the University of Cape Town, South Africa."
"May 24, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",What’s in the air,"Flemington, NJContinuing his work as an air monitoring specialist with the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.“If we can make air-quality monitors more accessible, communities and individuals can get timely data to help address air pollution in their own neighborhoods.”- GRAEME CARVLINWhere would a chemist with a serious electronics hobby and an interest in programming and atmospheric science go if he wanted to combine it all into one career focused on public health?For Graeme Carvlin, it all came together in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS), which recently named Carvlin as our 2018 Outstanding PhD Student.Carvlin’s research led to the development of an innovative technology that empowers local communities with up-to-the-minute data about air quality at a price that is about 95 percent less than the cost of existing sensors.The monitors provide real-time air-quality data at the neighborhood level for several DEOHS-led research studies, including one investigating the role of air pollution in communities along the California-Mexico border with some of California’s worst hospitalization rates for childhood asthma.DEOHS Associate Professor Edmund Seto, who leads that project, said Carvlin’s work played an important role in 2017 California legislation that uses revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program to fund air monitoring in communities statewide.Carvlin, who graduates this summer, worked with Imperial County, CA, to build and install a system of 40 air monitors to gather real-time data about local air pollution.The technology he developed is also being used in Seattle as part of a study investigating the link between air pollution and dementia and as part of a nationwide study examining the connection between air pollution and cardiovascular disease.The lunchbox-sized monitor includes a particle counter, gas sensors that measure gases regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a microcontroller and networking card. Unlike traditional sensors that measure air pulled through a filter, the monitor actively samples air passing over its sensors, transmitting the data to a UW database.Traditional air monitors cost about $25,000 each, he said. Carvlin’s version currently costs about $1,500.Carvlin and a team of student researchers working with Seto rigorously tested and validated the new technology. Some monitors were installed next to government-tested regulatory monitors so they could compare readings.And that comparison led to an unexpected finding: The upper limit of the government monitors was set too low to catch spikes in air pollution. They weren’t able to capture data that showed days when the air quality dropped. The government ultimately adjusted its own air monitors based on Carvlin’s research.Carvlin arrived at the UW in 2014 with a master’s in chemistry from the University of California, San Diego, and learned about DEOHS and Seto’s research through a colleague.“I felt it was a good set-up there to pursue what I was interested in,” he said. “I had a lot of leeway to work on the technical side of things while also pursuing my interest in improving public health.”Pollution is linked to one in every six deaths worldwide, with two-thirds of those deaths attributed to air pollution. High-quality, affordable air monitors will enable more communities and government agencies to collect data and work to reduce air pollution emissions, Carvlin predicted.That’s already happening in Imperial County, where local community members were handed control over the monitoring system and are now talking with regulatory authorities about ways to improve air quality.Soon, the monitors will be commercially available. In 2017, Seto and Carvlin received a grant to refine the monitor’s design from the CoMotion Innovation Fund, a partnership between UW CoMotion and the Washington Research Foundation that supports promising innovations.Now they are finalizing the technology for manufacture by further reducing the cost and assembly time.Carvlin is also working on a smaller personal version—wearable technology the size of a cell phone that will offer additional features, such as GPS and an accelerometer, and let consumers monitor ambient air quality in real time."
"May 23, 2018 | Rachel Shaffer",Biking in dirty air,"I see toxic chemicals everywhere.It’s an occupational hazard for me as a toxicology PhD student in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences. I spend my days learning and writing about all things environmental health, so naturally, I’m worried about my own exposures to the pollutants around us.I do what I can to minimize my exposures by buying organic, avoiding processed and packaged foods, minimizing my use of plastics, choosing fragrance-free products and searching for flame retardant-free furniture.Yet there’s one lifestyle choice that I’m not willing to give up: city biking.I bike to the UW every day. I love riding to campus; it’s my morning and evening meditation time and exercise.While I ride on the Burke-Gilman trail most of the way, there are several segments on roads. Obviously, biking on busy, car-filled streets presents immediate physical dangers.Just as worrisome to me is the air pollution I inhale as I take deep breaths alongside cars and buses. Luckily, I’m not affected by asthma or other respiratory problems. Yet I can’t help but think about the link between air pollution and other health issues, including cardiovascular disease and dementia (the subject of my PhD dissertation).Am I causing myself more harm than good on my bike commute? Why am I willing to impose strict controls on what I eat and buy, yet allow myself to breathe noxious miasma every single day?What am I breathing on my daily commute?It includes:Yuck.During vigorous exercise, we breathe in these pollutants at two to five times higher rates and more deeply than we do at rest.In studies of cyclists, researchers have found that biking in traffic is associated with short-term increases in inflammatory blood cells, decreased lung function and alterations in heart rate variability.We don’t yet fully understand the long-term consequences of these changes. While research to date suggests that the long-term benefits of biking outweigh the potential risks, current reviews may underestimate the long-term costs to my health because:I’m still trying to understand the calculations that led me to decide to expose myself to substantial pollution every day. Maybe it is because I have control in this situation? It is, after all, my choice to bike.Maybe it’s because Seattle appears to have relatively clean air compared to other places I’ve lived (Atlanta and Bangkok)?Or maybe I just love biking too much, and this is where I draw my personal line. While it is important to me to minimize harmful exposures, I can’t live in a bubble. Life involves risk, and I’ve somehow decided that this is one I’m willing to take. Biking every day brings me too much happiness to give up, at least for now.In the end, we need systemic, societal changes to make cities safer and healthier, including stricter controls of vehicle emissions and better bicycling infrastructure.- RACHEL SHAFFERWhile I continue to bike, there are things I can do to reduce my exposures.In addition to consistently wearing the air pollution mask I bought last summer, I can check local air quality (like through this pollution app) and avoid riding on particularly bad days. When bike paths are not available, I can find alternate routes on low-traffic roads where I will be less exposed to dirty air.As individuals, we have limited control over our own exposures. In the end, we need systemic, societal changes to make cities safer and healthier, including stricter controls of vehicle emissions, increased use of electric vehicles, improved public transportation, better bicycling infrastructure and more green space.Ultimately, I hope that my own research can demonstrate the importance of strengthening air quality regulations and inform policies to reduce exposures.It’s personal now.Read an extended version of this post on the Rachel Talks Tox blog."
"May 21, 2018 | Amanda Pain",From the Grand Canyon to remote Alaska,"Wenatchee, WAField environmental health officer for Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel, AK.“Growing up in Wenatchee, WA, I was exposed to a lot of agricultural workers. Learning about how the environment affects people’s health—and realizing that many people I knew growing up were exposed to health risks—really hooked me on environmental health.”- ALI EVERHARTAt the bottom of the Grand Canyon last summer, UW undergraduate Ali Everhart got an up-close look at the issues people in remote areas face when they can’t easily access health services.As part of an internship with the Indian Health Service, Everhart visited a tribal community located in a remote area of the Grand Canyon that could only be accessed by helicopter or an eight-mile hike.“There were a lot of logistical challenges to get supplies and personnel into this community,” Everhart said. “I learned a lot about the health issues that stem from lack of access. It was really eye-opening and motivated me to pursue work in rural communities after I graduate.”Everhart is being recognized this month as the 2018 Outstanding Bachelor’s Student for the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences.Everhart, who graduates next month, will build on what she learned when she starts a new job this summer as a field environmental health officer serving tribal communities in a remote western Alaska town only accessible by water or air. She will work with 15 rural communities to address environmental health issues.“I was compelled to take the position because of the opportunities to learn and do good work there,” she said. “There is more freedom . . . to choose the issues you want to pursue, which is not something a lot of recent graduates get to do.”Everhart’s internship with the Indian Health Service exposed her to the many environmental health issues Native American communities face, particularly those in rural areas.She worked from an office in western Arizona that provides services to five tribes, with most of her work focused on food safety, mosquito control and West Nile virus surveillance.Everhart assisted with food establishment and institutional inspections and provided outreach and training on topics such as cockroach and bedbug infestations. She also researched and developed training materials for local environmental health officers who conduct swimming pool inspections.Everhart tried many different courses at the UW before settling on a career in public health. She focused on environmental health after taking an elective course and eventually joined the leadership of the Student Environmental Health Association, where she planned events to help fellow students find internships and jobs in the field.Her studies have allowed her to combine two driving passions: the environment and helping others.“Everything we do in environmental health impacts every person on this earth,” Everhart said. “With finite resources and growing populations, there will always be new challenges in this field. As our world continues to grow and change, this work will be even more important.”"
"May 16, 2018 | Amanda Pain",Research with real-world impact,"Ljubljana, SloveniaHealth and environmental investigator for Public Health —Seattle & King County’s on-site sewage system program.“I have benefited from people wanting to empower me. Now I want to do the same, especially for underserved communities that lack power.”- MEAGAN JACKSONMeagan Jackson’s UW education gave her the chance to work in the field—and she has the grass stains on her jeans to prove it.Jackson spent much of last summer kneeling in fields and backyards around Western Washington collecting water samples from about 100 septic systems to evaluate the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection used in thousands of residential septic systems statewide.Jackson was recognized this month as the 2018 Outstanding Master’s Student for the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).Her master’s program produced research publications and a national conference presentation and is likely to influence revised state policies on the disinfection of septic systems located near sensitive waterways and aquifers.Washington has nearly 1 million on-site sewage systems treating wastewater from homes and businesses. When those systems aren’t properly maintained, they can release human waste and dangerous bacteria and pathogens into waterways, leading to serious health and economic consequences.Jackson worked with the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) to assess whether UV light units are effective in disinfecting septic systems. She coordinated the study, recruited participants, conducted field work and managed data analysis. She wrote the final report that will be submitted to the Washington State Board of Health.Jackson, who graduates this summer, said she feels proud of her work, which helped answer some long-standing questions from participants about how their systems work and the importance of maintaining them. DEOHS lecturer Tania Busch Isaksen, Jackson's adviser, called Jackson ""a real stand-out"" whose work illustrates the impact students have when they can put their research and education into practiceOriginally from Slovenia, Jackson studied environmental science as an undergraduate at Wheaton College and spent six months in Thailand learning about sustainable international development. The experience reinforced her desire to work in environmental health.“So far in my training, I have benefited from people wanting to empower me,” Jackson said. “I want to do the same, especially for underserved communities that lack power.”In Thailand, Jackson saw how much people’s lives depended directly on their environment and learned to listen closely to their ideas about the connections between their health and their environment.“The general US focus on science in environmental health is important, but some cultures are more likely to adopt prevention strategies that stress the relationships between people and nature,” she said.Randy Freeby, health services consultant for the DOH wastewater section, called Jackson “an amazing learner who grasps information quickly.”Freeby said DOH regulations on UV units were last updated in 2005. Today, there are nearly 6,000 UV units statewide.The study concluded that while UV disinfection reduced fecal bacteria in wastewater, about half of the units assessed were not working properly. Freeby said the report makes recommendations to improve the performance of UV units through action by state and local health departments, the state Board of Health, homeowners and maintenance providers.Jackson said she was drawn to the MS program in DEOHS because it allowed her to pursue research projects that engaged community members. During her studies, Jackson also worked on a second project with community impact—assessing a communication tool used to teach immigrant populations about heat-related illnesses.Looking ahead, Jackson hopes to work internationally and in partnership with communities to implement environmental health programs."

"May 11, 2018 | Jolayne Houtz",Standing up for science,"Lianne Sheppard imagined a career in service to both science and the public good when she joined the UW faculty 24 years ago.She never anticipated that one day, she would have to choose between them.Sheppard is professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and biostatistics, and assistant chair of the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS).She is also the plaintiff in a lawsuit against the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over a surprise directive issued by Administrator Scott Pruitt last fall that prohibits scientists who receive EPA funding from serving on its advisory boards.The directive left Sheppard with a stark choice:Continue pursuing her EPA-funded research on air pollution and its connection to heart disease? Or walk away from the research and keep her seat on the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee?The committee advises the EPA on implementation of the landmark Clean Air Act. Backers of the directive say panel members who also receive EPA grants may be compromised by the money and less inclined to provide objective reviews and recommendations to the EPA.“That to me causes questions on the independence and the veracity and the transparency of those recommendations that are coming our way,” Pruitt said during an event last fall at the Heritage Foundation.But critics argue the real goal is to open the door for industry-aligned researchers and others who have opposed tighter regulations, giving them more influence over environmental policy. They note that scientists affiliated with private industry and local government will not face a similar requirement.Sheppard and the nonprofit advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists sued the EPA in January, saying the directive targets academic scientists in “an attempt to delegitimize and suppress the role of academic scientists advising the agency and, by extension, the results of their research.”Sheppard initially hesitated to take such a public stand by joining the lawsuit. She is suing as an individual and not on behalf of the UW.Serving on EPA advisory panels helps ensure scientific evidence and expertise are at the heart of environmental policymaking, she said. She notes that safeguards against conflicts of interest already exist, including required annual financial disclosures by panel members.“Those with standing should fight for national parks, for immigrant rights—and I can fight for science.”- LIANNE SHEPPARDUntil recently, Sheppard served as co-investigator on the largest study of its kind looking at the link between air pollution and subclinical measures of heart disease. The research team was awarded a new $3 million EPA grant to continue the work in October, the same month Pruitt announced his directive.Dr. Joel Kaufman, DEOHS professor and interim dean of the UW School of Public Health, is the lead investigator on that study. He chose to continue leading the air pollution study and was recently informed by the EPA that he can no longer serve on a Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee panel evaluating particulate matter.“I’ve invested the last 10 years of my life in that research,” Sheppard said. “This directive forces me to choose between my own work and my commitment to the public.”She decided to walk away from the grant after talking to a longtime friend who told her: This is just another way to the serve the public good.“This is something I can do as one individual,” Sheppard said. “When you see something you feel is deeply wrong, and you’re in a place to stand up, you should stand up.”She hopes her actions encourage others to stand up in their own ways.“Those with standing should fight for national parks, for immigrant rights—and I can fight for science.”Sheppard sees hopeful signs of civic re-engagement recently in the protest marches, the MeToo movement, the surge in people running for public office.Scientists, too, need to stand up for truth and integrity, she said. That’s a theme echoed in UW President Ana Mari Cauce’s recent spring address encouraging faculty to serve as public ambassadors “for the passion that we came here to pursue.”“It’s in the public interest to make sure we have the most informed set of scientific voices giving advice to the EPA,” Sheppard said. “Weakening our ability to use good science to drive policy will mean weaker protections for public health—and we’ll all be affected by that.”"

"May 22, 2017 | Sally James","Leader, innovator, tinkerer"," Editor's note: Professor Michael Yost joined the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) in 1993 and was named department chair in 2014. I’d rather think of myself as an innovator. Inventors create things, but innovators come up with whole new ways of thinking about problems.The OP-FTIR (Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared) spectrometer is an optical technique that uses the rotational and vibrational modes of molecules to identify them. It is a little like a fingerprint of a chemical. It allows remote sensing (in situ) of chemicals over a big area, like a field, factory or pond, by probing the area with a light beam. It can very precisely identify what contaminants are out there.These ideas have been around since the 1990s, but the existing lab instruments were big and clunky and usually required us to bring the sample into the machine. The idea of a smaller, field-deployable unit that measured gases directly in the environment was different. Much of what we worked on was making the device calculate the concentration of a substance, say methane, and localize or map that distribution in space. It was a pretty big deal when we finally achieved it. It allowed people to apply this at places like Hanford, or in landfills. It has been used in many settings.Yes, I do like to get down in the weeds. Soon after the OP-FTIR, we also wanted to measure fluxes and the emissions over time. Often it is hard to know the emission rate of something from a source over time. We were able to develop a method the EPA later adopted. The technique also was picked up by the US Department of Agriculture for measuring emissions from farms or ponds of decomposing material.I got there because of prodding along the way and people who took an interest in me and my career. I was always interested in environmental sciences and was lucky to get a job as an undergraduate in a laboratory with Albert Krueger, who was a microbiologist and Naval officer. He did a lot of work on microbes and transmission of diseases in World War II. When I was ready to graduate, he helped me get a job on a Navy project, which was fairly long-term. During that time I decided to get an advanced degree, and that was a pivotal moment. I had many good experiences at Berkeley. You could stretch your imagination there. I worked in environmental health – but I was interested in electromagnetics. The Navy project I worked on included testing antennas. I was always interested in electrical engineering, so that was a great fit for me.When I got my PhD, another mentor told me about a project with Steve Levine, a professor at Michigan, and that was a seminal moment. That project involved optical sensing of workplace contaminants, which again was a nice fit with my interest in electromagnetics. We got a NIOSH grant – that was something I didn’t anticipate. It took 10 to 15 years of work and we invented a bunch of stuff.I could have kept just doing my research for another 10 or 15 years. But I’m interested in people. Organizations, like machines, require tinkering. How can I make it work well, and be resilient? I thought that was an interesting challenge. I really like this place and want us to contribute and make a lasting impact. One more award for me or one more toy is fine, but self-serving. But if I could make this workplace better and have people feel better about their contributions to the world – that seemed like a good place to put my efforts.Our strength is bringing in a lot of different disciplines to work on a problem. Getting people to work together is sometimes a challenge, but that is where all the interesting science happens. I want to build our interdisciplinary culture and foster that “eureka moment” of insight. When I consider giving a short, elevator talk, I always say, “We find ways to promote clean air, clean water, safe workplaces, safe food and healthy communities.” If we can do all those things, it makes life better. What we do falls into those big buckets. I would like to see us partner with some businesses to help them improve the sustainability of what they are doing.What’s next on the horizon? We are looking at putting a focus on the human microbiome as a theme for our cross-cutting research next year. It is fascinating in many ways. It allows us to wonder – how does the environment interface with us? We can bring toxicology and microbiology into the investigation. We are poised to launch an initiative to seed ideas internally but also bring in outside experts. Knit things together as an area of focus.I play guitar and bass. I’ve also picked up the ukulele.I have a wife and two daughters. One daughter just graduated from Washington State University. The other went to the University of Hawaii. My wife was an elementary school teacher – but is now working as a substitute."

"May 1, 2016 |",2016: Awards for excellence,"  Students, staff and faculty members from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) were recognized in 2016 by their colleagues in the department and in the UW School of Public Health (SPH) for their contributions to scientific research, education and community service.The department's Graduate Student Advisory Committee (SAC) awarded the 2016 Outstanding Faculty Mentor to Professor Terrance Kavanagh. SAC created the award in 2006 to recognize faculty members who have gone above and beyond their commitment to mentor students in research and in professional development. Kavanagh was nominated by students for his “open door policy,” even for those students who are not part of his lab, which speaks to his commitment to teaching and student success. “He continually goes above and beyond his responsibilities as a mentor and professor in our department,"" writes one student. ""Not only is he an excellent advisor, researcher, and teacher, he is simply a good person willing to help you with anything, professional or personal.”     Elizabeth Guzy joined the department in July 2014 from Harvard University. In DEOHS, she manages a large federally funded project, the Center for Ecogenetics and Environmental Health. After only a few months in the job, she was already pulling together a large competing renewal (700+ pages!). Last year, Guzy graciously volunteered to help manage a similarly large research center, the Superfund Research Program and provide key support for the center’s competitive renewal. She has stayed true to her roots growing up in Colorado – she bikes all over Seattle and loves to spend time outdoors with her husband and close friends.     Alexandra Kossik, a research scientist in the department, has a track record for volunteering. She fundraises and recruits athletes for the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life. She visits middle schools, where she talks with students about being a scientist or the importance of vaccines. Alexandra has also been a Girl Scout troop leader the last five years. Owing that she has been involved in the Girl Scouts since the third grade, she serves as an inspiration and role model for young girls. Alexandra finds opportunities to incorporate public health principles into Girl Scout activities, such as food safety while camping and the benefits of home-cooked food.     Magali Blanco is a second-year student in the MS Occupational and Environmental Exposure Science degree program. Before coming to the University of Washington, she received a BA in Biology from Lewis & Clark College. Magali is working with Professor Richard Fenske to investigate the effect of using different spray technologies on pesticide drift in neighboring orchards. The study aims to better characterize pesticide drift patterns as well as potential worker exposures, spatially and temporally. This research is the first to use time series data to better characterize drift variability during a spray event, a limitation of traditional aggregate models. Magali received funding from the Graduate Opportunities and Minority Achievement Program to support her research.     Former PhD student and research scientist, Megan Cartwright, wrote a variety of columns for Slate -- including on lead contamination, parasites in swimming pools, and mosquitoes that transmit disease – that directly involve public health, as well pieces about disease, science, and the natural world, all related to public health. Most important, the columns were written in an engaging, non-jargony style, guaranteed to engage everyday readers. Her Twitter feed and blog are other channels that communicate health and science to the public in an accessible way. With PhD in hand, Cartwright has chosen to work in the field of medical and science writing. She is a role model for other researchers in her efforts to communicate public health and science broadly.     Physician Shilpa Gowda will graduate this spring with an MPH in Occupation and Environmental Medicine from the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences. She treats injured workers in the Occupational and Environmental Medicine clinic at Harborview and the Occupational Medicine clinic at Group Health Bellevue. Her care also addresses how to prevent workplace injuries. At the department’s Future of Occupational Health conference, she spoke about the Affordable Care Act and workers’ compensation. Gowda researches the public’s potential environmental exposures from industrial processes. She conducted a large epidemiologic study to examine association between outside air pollution and lung cancer risk.     Undergraduate Sara Mar declared her major in 2014, and has made outstanding achievements ever since. She plans to graduate in 2017. Sara’s goal is to be an environmental health specialist working with underserved communities, and she has participated in experiences to prepare her. For the past two years, she has volunteered during spring break at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, Washington, teaching environmental education to first- through sixth-grade students. Last year Sara worked with researchers in the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center, studying the effectiveness of integrated pest management strategies in decreasing pesticide exposures among dairy workers in Washington. Mar was recently selected for the highly competitive Junior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program with the U.S. Public Health Service, which she will complete in Summer 2016.     Jane Pouzou is a PhD candidate for the Environmental and Occupational Hygiene degree in the department. She studies comparative risk assessment methods, with a focus on how decisions are made in selecting pesticides. She is developing a model that assigns numerical values to the factors that influence pesticide selection and to estimates for different health risks. The model could help the industry better understand tradeoffs in risks to worker health and safety among pesticides. Pouzou was selected for the Environmental Pathology/Toxicology Training Program and for the Russell L. Castner Endowed Student Research Fund award. She earned an MPH from the University of Virginia.     Kristen Slodysko’s interest in Environmental Health stemmed from a 15-month research and fieldwork experience in Cairo, Egypt while completing a B.A. degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from UW. Seeing the health hazards from agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage inspired Slodysko to shift her career aspirations toward environmental health. She returned to Seattle to work as an environmental educator, joining DEOHS’ undergraduate program as a post-baccalaureate student. While maintaining a 3.96 GPA, Slodysko assisted other researchers on a method to test workers’ exposures to pesticides. She graduated Winter quarter and will start a graduate program at the State University of New York in the Fall.     David Scoville is a fourth-year student in the PhD Environmental Toxicology degree program. He received a BSPH in Environmental Sciences and Engineering from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and an MS in Environmental Toxicology from our department. Scoville is working with Professor Terrance Kavanagh to investigate genetic differences in susceptibility to nanoparticle toxicity, particularly lung inflammation. Understanding the variation in response and those genes responsible could help influence standards to adequately protect sensitive
individuals. Scoville has been a teaching assistant in an undergraduate toxicology course and has guest-lectured in both undergraduate and graduate toxicology courses. He was graduate student representative for the Pacific Northwest Regional Chapter of the Society of Toxicology, served on the department’s Student Advisory Committee and as student representative on the department’s Curriculum Committee.

"May 12, 2015 |",2015: Awards for excellence,"  Students, staff and faculty members from the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) were recognized in 2015 by their colleagues in the department and in the UW School of Public Health (SPH) for their contributions to scientific research, education and community service. The department's Graduate Student Advisory Committee (SAC) awarded the 2015 Outstanding Faculty Mentor to Professor John Kissel and Professor Elaine Faustman. SAC created the award in 2006 to recognize faculty members who have gone above and beyond their commitment to mentor students in research and in professional development. This is the first year DEOHS students have chosen to give the award to two members of our faculty who each represent different styles of mentoring beneficial to students. Both of these faculty members were nominated with overwhelming support from students, highlighting their mentoring strengths. Professor Kissel dives into the details of students’ work in order to help them better understand concepts and better their research. One student noted “He has stayed late to assist students with problems they are having with their projects (even with students that do not work for him), and he has spent full afternoons troubleshooting issues with us.” Professor  Faustman fosters professional navigation and development as another student commented that  “…her knowledge, experience, and advice have truly helped me grow in my career and as a person.” While different in their strengths, students agree that their mentoring abilities are exemplary and that these two styles should be encouraged throughout the department. Their mentoring allows students to grow personally and professionally into research scientists. While their commitment to quality science and the development of new research is nationally and internationally recognized, it’s their care and dedication to their students that make them exemplary mentors.Joel Kaufman is a physician-epidemiologist, and has been a full-time faculty member at the University of Washington since 1997. The award for Outstanding Faculty Mentor recognizes excellence in academic and personal mentoring, career mentoring, advocacy, and leadership. An outstanding mentor respects student’s goals and helps students work toward them while providing a good model of professionalism, demonstrated awareness, and a respect for difference. Kaufman currently holds appointments in the Departments of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, and Medicine (General Internal Medicine), and Epidemiology. He directs the academic program and research in Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which is split between our department and the Division of General Internal Medicine. His current research activities are primarily focused on environmental factors in cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Kaufman’s research integrates the disciplines of epidemiology, exposure sciences, toxicology, and clinical medicine, and he mentors students and trainees in each of these disciplines. Alison Laing, a program operations specialist in our department’s Institute for Risk Analysis and Risk Communication, has a reputation for pitching in and helping with any task, however complex or simple, large or small. She started in the department as a student assistant. Then after graduating from the University of Washington with a BA in International Studies, she started working full time in the Institute. She has assumed more and more responsibilities over the years. She is now responsible for grant planning. She administers budgets, coordinates meetings, and organizes webinars and research symposia. She helped develop the new website for the Center for Child Environment Health Risks Research. Last year, Laing shepherded a multi-million dollar grant through a new federal submission system online, despite a technical glitch that could have jeopardized the whole application. As a result of her experience, she now mentors others to use the system.  Eric Vigoren, associate director of the Continuing Education Programs in our department, is the treasurer for the Seattle International Randonneurs, a long distance bicycling organization. As a long-time volunteer for this popular club, he is responsible for fiscal and compliance matters. He organizes events, manages finances, coordinates fellow volunteers, and pedals thousands of miles every year. Vigoren shares his passion for the sport by mentoring other riders and people interested in the sport. His leadership and efforts in building a welcoming community motivate others in the organization to give back.  Elisabeth Lara transferred to UW from Cascadia Community College in Autumn 2013, and quickly found her academic home in the Environmental Health Undergraduate Program. She completed her internship at Microchem Laboratories, a microbiology facility that tests foods and edible products for microorganisms and allergens to help the food industry make the food supply safer and more shelf-stable. Lara was offered a permanent position as a laboratory technician. She worked part-time while she completed her B.S. in Environmental Health. During the past year, she worked in Professor Marilyn Roberts’ laboratory, investigating whether the MRSA found on samples were community or hospital-acquired strains. This summer she will intern in the food/shellfish division at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory as a laboratory assistant. In addition to being a strong student academically, Lara has made a lasting impression both inside and outside the classroom. Her internship supervisor described her as “exceptionally intelligent and mature.” The department’s nominating committee all commented on her inquisitive and thoughtful engagement with faculty and other students in the classroom. Undergraduate Madison McInnis’s leadership, maturity, and professionalism were all factors in her selection for this prestigious award. McInnis joined the Environmental Health major and the Student Environmental Health Association (SEHA) in 2013, and currently serves as SEHA’s co-leader. This year, she was also chosen to serve as the student representative for the department’s nationwide Instructor Candidate search. McInnis was selected to participate in the 2015 Summer Undergraduate Program in Environmental Health with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health in Atlanta. Interns participate in activities with the Environmental Health Services Branch in order to gain a variety of experiences and an understanding of environmental health work at the local, state, tribal, and federal levels. McInnis will also work on her own Environmental Health research project.  Jonathan Nagata is graduating from the concurrent degree program with a Master of Science in Environmental Health and a Master of Public Administration. During his time at UW, Nagata served as president of the School’s Student Public Health Association, president of Rainbow Grads, and student representative on the School’s Executive Committee. He was an active member of the School’s Deans’ Advisory Council for Students, the department’s Student Advisory Committee, and the University’s Graduate and Professional Student Senate. Nagata interned with Snohomish County and worked with the Washington State Department of Health to develop and lead a training series for water treatment operators and managers. His thesis examined the health risks associated with apple contamination from irrigation water. Faculty who nominated him for the award noted that Nagata is an exceptionally well-spoken and outstanding student, who has a tremendous future in public and environmental health. Trevor Peckham will graduate this spring with two Master’s degrees: Environmental Health and Public Administration. His research looks at dermal exposures to a carcinogenic combustion product found in soil, with implications for workers cleaning up contaminated sites. Trevor won the 2014 School of Public Health Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award. He founded and served as co-chair of the Dean’s Advisory Council for Students and has been active in the department’s Student Advisory Council. He was vice president of the School’s Student Public Health Association. Peckam presented to Senator Patty Murray’s staff, and was selected to participate in the Surgeon General’s visit to campus. He helped plan and presented at the Worker Memorial Day event in April. In addition, he has mentored both undergraduate and elementary school students interested in science careers. In 2014, Peckam was chosen to be a guest researcher at the National Center for Environmental Health in Atlanta. Peckham has published three academic papers, with another two in preparation. His academic and civic achievements reflect his potential to significantly contribute to public health and public policy. Undergraduate Alex Walton was diagnosed with type-1 juvenile diabetes at a young age. Her passion for health studies stems from living with this disease. At the University of Washington, she majored in Environmental Health. During her sophomore and junior years, she worked in Associate Professor Maitreya Dunham's lab in the Department of Genome Sciences, estimating that she probably cleaned 10,000 test tubes and autoclaved glassware 200 times during her time there. She chose a career in industrial hygiene and occupational safety because it was a natural fit for her interests in health studies and her strong desire to help people. With the knowledge she has obtained at UW, Walton hopes she can continue to improve safety and industrial hygiene practices in the workplace, especially for private industry. Immediately after graduating, she will begin a second internship in occupational health and safety with Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Everett, Washington. Gonfalonieres lead their degree candidates in the procession at the University of Washington’s Commencement Ceremony. These students are called gonfalonieres because they carry the school’s gonfalon, a banner that hangs down from a crosspiece and bears that school’s name and symbol. Sheldwin Yazzie—a PhD student in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences—demonstrates a commitment to public health in researching indoor radon exposure in the Navajo Nation. A colorless, ordorless gas, radon comes from uranium, and is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Members of Yazzie’s own family are former Navajo uranium miners. In order to develop a predictive model to estimate individual radon exposure, he worked closely with and had the support of community members to collect radon data from Navajo homes. Yazzie has a strong academic record, including one published paper and another in preparation. In his nomination, a faculty mentor wrote that “his research will have far-reaching implications for tackling radon exposure in the Navajo Nation and for better understanding of environmental radon exposure in general.” After earning his degree, he will continue to promote public health in the Navajo Nation."
